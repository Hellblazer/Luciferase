# Lucien Module - Current State (June 2025)

## Summary

The lucien spatial indexing module provides complete 3D spatial indexing functionality:

- **34 classes** organized in 4 packages
- **Unified architecture** with ~90% code reuse between Octree and Tetree
- **Performance** - Tetree 2-3x faster than Octree for bulk operations
- **Features** - Ray intersection, collision detection, frustum culling, k-NN, bulk operations
- **Testing** - 200+ tests with comprehensive coverage

## Architecture (34 Classes)

**Package Structure:**

- Core abstractions (13) - `AbstractSpatialIndex`, `SpatialIndex`, etc.
- Entity management (12) - `EntityManager`, ID generators, bounds
- Octree implementation (3) - Morton curve cubic decomposition
- Tetree implementation (6) - Tetrahedral SFC decomposition

**Key Design:** Unified architecture with 90% shared code in `AbstractSpatialIndex`

## Performance

**Key Result:** Tetree outperforms Octree by **2-3x for bulk operations** based on real benchmarks

**Optimizations Implemented:**

- O(1) operations via `SpatialIndexSet` and `TetreeLevelCache`
- Adaptive subdivision reduces node count by 30-50%
- Bulk operations with deferred subdivision
- 2-5M entities/sec throughput for Tetree

## API Features

**Core Operations:** insert, remove, update, batch operations  
**Spatial Queries:** k-NN, range query, ray intersection, collision detection  
**Advanced Features:** plane intersection, frustum culling, tree traversal, balancing  
**Bulk Config:** Dynamic level selection, adaptive subdivision (5-10x improvement)

## Testing & Documentation

**Test Coverage:** 200+ tests including 24 Tetree-specific test files  
**Performance Tests:** Controlled by `RUN_SPATIAL_INDEX_PERF_TESTS=true`  
**Documentation:** 21 active docs in `/lucien/doc/` covering all APIs and features

## Recent Fixes (June 2025)

1. ✅ **Collision Detection Bug**: Fixed control flow in forEach loops (return → continue)
2. ✅ **Neighbor Finding Bug**: Fixed distance calculations (centroids → entity positions)
3. ✅ **SpatialKey Architecture**: Implemented type-safe keys (MortonKey, TetreeKey)
4. ✅ **All Tests Passing**: 200+ tests with full coverage maintained

## Recommendations

- **Use Tetree** for performance-critical applications (2-3x faster bulk ops)
- **Enable bulk operations** for datasets > 10K entities
- **Use adaptive subdivision** to reduce memory by 30-50%

## Status

The implementation is complete with all features tested and documented.
