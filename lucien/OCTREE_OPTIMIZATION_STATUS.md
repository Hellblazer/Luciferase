## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (2025-06-19)

### Completed Phases:
- ✅ **Phase 1.2**: BulkOperationProcessor - Morton code batch processing
- ✅ **Phase 1.3**: DeferredSubdivisionManager - Deferred subdivision tracking
- ✅ **Phase 2.3**: SpatialNodePool - Memory pooling implementation
- ✅ **Phase 3.1**: ParallelBulkOperations - Concurrent processing
- ✅ **Phase 3.2**: FineGrainedLockingStrategy - Node-level locking with StampedLock
- ✅ **Phase 4.1**: SubdivisionStrategy - Sophisticated control flow for subdivision decisions

### In Progress:
- ⏳ **Phase 5.1**: StackBasedTreeBuilder - Depth-first construction

### Remaining:
- ⏸️ **Phase 6**: Performance benchmarks
- ⏸️ **Phase 7**: Integration and documentation

### Key Achievements:
- Node pool integration successful - 47% hit rate in tests
- Fine-grained locking with optimistic concurrency control
- Parallel bulk operations with spatial region partitioning
- Sophisticated subdivision strategies for both Octree and Tetree
- Support for different workload patterns (dense points, large entities, mixed)
- All compilation errors resolved and tests passing

### Phase 4.1 Completion Details:
- Created abstract SubdivisionStrategy base class with control flow enum
- Implemented OctreeSubdivisionStrategy with Morton code-based decisions
- Implemented TetreeSubdivisionStrategy with tetrahedral geometry awareness
- Added multiple control flow options: INSERT_IN_PARENT, SPLIT_TO_CHILDREN, CREATE_SINGLE_CHILD, etc.
- Configurable strategies for different use cases (dense point clouds, large entities, balanced)
- Comprehensive unit tests passing
