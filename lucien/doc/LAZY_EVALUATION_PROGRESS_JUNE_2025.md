# Lazy TetreeKey Evaluation Progress - June 2025

## What We've Implemented

### 1. LazyTetreeKey Class

- Extends TetreeKey to defer tmIndex() computation
- Pre-computes hash for HashMap efficiency
- Only resolves tmIndex when needed for comparison/ordering

### 2. Tetree Integration

- Added `useLazyEvaluation` configuration flag
- Modified `calculateSpatialIndex()` to return lazy keys when enabled
- Added `resolveLazyKeys()` method for batch resolution

### 3. Test Results

The initial test run shows mixed results:

#### Batch Operations (Success!)

```
Regular batch: 9.34 ms
Lazy batch: 3.35 ms
Batch speedup: 2.79x
```

**Lazy evaluation provides 2.79x speedup for batch operations!**

#### Single Insertions (Unexpected)

```
Regular insertion: 1.55 ms (1.55 μs/entity)
Lazy insertion: 2.00 ms (2.00 μs/entity)
Speedup: 0.78x
```

**Lazy is slower for single insertions - needs investigation**

#### Key Observations

1. Only 424 out of 1000 keys remained lazy (spatial locality reduces unique nodes)
2. Resolution time: 2.76 ms for 424 keys (~6.5 μs per key)
3. Cache hit rate: 99.80% (excellent)

## Why Single Insert is Slower

The overhead comes from:

1. Creating LazyTetreeKey wrapper objects
2. Additional indirection for operations
3. The spatial index likely forces resolution during insertion checks

## Next Steps

### 1. Optimize LazyTetreeKey

- Reduce object allocation overhead
- Inline critical methods
- Consider object pooling

### 2. Delay Resolution Further

- Investigate where keys are being resolved prematurely
- Modify sorted set operations to defer ordering
- Batch resolution at strategic points

### 3. Selective Lazy Evaluation

- Only use lazy keys for bulk operations
- Keep direct computation for single inserts
- Hybrid approach based on operation type

## Conclusion

Lazy evaluation shows promise for bulk operations (2.79x speedup) but needs refinement for single insertions. The
concept is sound - we just need to optimize the implementation to reduce overhead.
