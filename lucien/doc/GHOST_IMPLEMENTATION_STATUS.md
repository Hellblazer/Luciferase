### Design Decisions

1. **Dual Approach**: Supporting both distance-based (GhostZoneManager) and topology-based (ElementGhostManager) ghost detection
2. **gRPC over MPI**: Using gRPC for distributed communication instead of MPI
3. **Protobuf Serialization**: Using Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization
4. **Generic Support**: Maintaining generic type support throughout the implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 3: Implement gRPC Services**
   - Create GhostExchangeService server implementation
   - Add client connection management
   - Implement streaming protocols for real-time updates

2. **Phase 2: Protocol Buffer Integration**
   - Complete protobuf conversion methods for existing ghost classes
   - Implement generic content serialization strategy
   - Create efficient batch serialization for network transport

3. **Phase 5: Distributed Testing**
   - ✅ Unit tests for neighbor detection (completed)
   - ✅ Integration tests for ghost creation (completed)  
   - Integration tests with gRPC (next priority)
   - Distributed tests across multiple processes

## Performance Considerations

1. **Neighbor Detection**: O(1) for Morton codes, O(level) for Tetree keys
2. **Ghost Storage**: O(log n) operations with ConcurrentSkipListMap
3. **Network Communication**: Batched operations to minimize round trips
4. **Serialization**: Efficient protobuf encoding with streaming support

## Known Issues

1. **Tetree Performance**: O(level) tmIndex() computation affects neighbor finding
2. **Generic Content Serialization**: Need strategy for arbitrary content types
3. **Scalability**: Need to test with large distributed deployments
