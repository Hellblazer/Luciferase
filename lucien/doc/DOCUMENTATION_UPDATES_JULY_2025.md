# Documentation Updates - July 6, 2025

## Summary of Updates

This document tracks the documentation updates made to reflect the current implementation status, particularly the S0-S5 tetrahedral decomposition that replaced the legacy ei/ej algorithm.

## Files Updated

### 1. LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE_2025.md
- **Added**: Mention of S0-S5 decomposition in the overview
- **Added**: Detailed S0-S5 Tetrahedral Decomposition section under Tetree Implementation
- **Added**: Note that Tet.coordinates() returns actual S0-S5 vertices (not AABB approximation)
- **Updated**: Date to July 2025 - Latest Update

### 2. PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_HISTORY.md
- **Added**: New section "July 6, 2025 - S0-S5 Tetrahedral Decomposition"
- **Details**: Documents the fix from 35% to 100% containment rate
- **Impact**: Shows how visualization now correctly displays entities

### 3. ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY_2025.md
- **Updated**: Date to July 6, 2025
- **Added**: Mention of S0-S5 decomposition providing 100% geometric containment
- **Added**: S0-S5 section in Recent Updates with problem, cause, solution, and results

### 4. VERTEX_COMPUTATION_ANALYSIS.md
- **Added**: [OUTDATED - JULY 2025] tag to title
- **Added**: Note directing readers to S0_S5_DECOMPOSITION_REFERENCE.md for current implementation
- **Reason**: This document describes the legacy ei/ej algorithm that is no longer used

### 5. TETREE_T8CODE_PARTITION_ANALYSIS.md
- **Added**: [OUTDATED - JULY 2025] tag to title
- **Added**: Note explaining this analysis was based on the legacy algorithm
- **Reason**: The gaps and overlaps described were artifacts of the old implementation

## Key Changes Documented

### S0-S5 Tetrahedral Decomposition
- **Replaced**: Legacy ei/ej algorithm with standard S0-S5 decomposition
- **Result**: 100% cube coverage with no gaps or overlaps
- **Impact**: Correct geometric containment for all entities
- **Standard**: Matches academic literature for tetrahedral cube decomposition

### Performance Timeline Updated
- Documents the progression from June 24 to July 6, 2025
- Shows cumulative 256-385x performance improvement for Tetree
- Includes the geometric correctness fix as the final milestone

### Outdated Documents Marked
- Documents analyzing the old ei/ej algorithm are now clearly marked as outdated
- Readers are directed to current implementation documentation

- **Original Analysis**: S0S5_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md
- **Implementation Details**: See Tet.coordinates() method in the source code

## Note

All "future work" mentioned in the documentation has been completed as of July 2025. The architecture is now feature-complete with all planned enhancements implemented.
