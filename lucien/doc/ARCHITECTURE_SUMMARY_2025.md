# Architecture Summary - January 2025

## Purpose

This document provides a high-level summary of the Luciferase lucien module architecture as of January 2025. For
detailed information, see the comprehensive documentation in this directory.

## Current State

The lucien module provides spatial indexing through a unified architecture supporting both octree and tetrahedral
decomposition. Following major consolidation in January 2025, the module uses inheritance to maximize code reuse while
maintaining the unique characteristics of each approach.

**Total Classes: 34** (organized across 4 packages)

## Package Overview

For detailed package structure and class descriptions, see [LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE_2025.md](./LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE_2025.md).

- **Root Package (13 classes)**: Core abstractions, spatial types, geometry utilities
- **Entity Package (12 classes)**: Complete entity management infrastructure
- **Octree Package (3 classes)**: Morton curve-based cubic spatial decomposition
- **Tetree Package (6 classes)**: Tetrahedral spatial decomposition

## Key Architecture Components

### Inheritance Hierarchy

```
SpatialIndex (interface)
  └── AbstractSpatialIndex (base class with ~90% shared functionality)
      ├── Octree (Morton curve-based)
      └── Tetree (tetrahedral SFC-based)
```

### Major Features

- **Unified API**: Both octree and tetree share common operations through AbstractSpatialIndex
- **Entity Management**: Centralized through EntityManager with multi-entity support
- **Thread Safety**: ReadWriteLock-based concurrent access
- **Performance**: HashMap-based O(1) node access for both implementations

## What This Architecture Includes

✅ **Core Spatial Indexing**: Insert, remove, update, lookup operations  
✅ **Spatial Queries**: Bounded/bounding queries, k-NN search, range queries  
✅ **Ray Intersection**: Complete ray traversal implementation (
see [RAY_INTERSECTION_API.md](./RAY_INTERSECTION_API.md))  
✅ **Collision Detection**: Broad/narrow phase collision detection (
see [COLLISION_DETECTION_API.md](./COLLISION_DETECTION_API.md))  
✅ **Tree Traversal**: Visitor pattern support (see [TREE_TRAVERSAL_API.md](./TREE_TRAVERSAL_API.md))  
✅ **Tree Balancing**: Dynamic balancing strategies (see [TREE_BALANCING_API.md](./TREE_BALANCING_API.md))  
✅ **Entity Spanning**: Advanced policies for large entities

## What This Architecture Does NOT Include

❌ **Specialized Search Classes**: No separate search implementations  
❌ **Optimizer Classes**: No performance optimization layers  
❌ **Spatial Engine Layer**: Direct use of spatial indices  
❌ **Parallel Processing**: Single-threaded with thread-safety  
❌ **Adapter Patterns**: Clean inheritance instead

## Architectural Evolution

The codebase underwent dramatic simplification in 2025:

- **From**: 60+ planned classes with complex abstractions
- **To**: 34 actual classes with direct APIs
- **Focus**: Core functionality over premature optimization

## Design Philosophy

The current architecture prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Essential functionality without unnecessary complexity
2. **Code Reuse**: 90% shared implementation through inheritance
3. **Maintainability**: Single place for algorithm changes
4. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new spatial decomposition strategies
5. **Performance**: O(1) operations through HashMap-based storage

## Testing Coverage

**134 total tests** with comprehensive coverage:

- Unit tests for all major operations
- Integration tests for spatial queries
- Performance benchmarks (11 skipped in CI)
- Thread-safety tests for concurrent operations
