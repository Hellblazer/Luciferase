# Architecture Summary - July 6, 2025 (Updated)

## Purpose

This document provides a high-level summary of the Luciferase lucien module architecture as of July 2025. For
detailed information, see the comprehensive documentation in this directory.

## Current State

The lucien module provides spatial indexing through a unified architecture supporting both octree and tetrahedral
decomposition. Following major consolidation in January 2025, the module uses inheritance to maximize code reuse while
maintaining the unique characteristics of each approach. As of July 2025, all planned enhancements have been completed,
including the critical S0-S5 tetrahedral decomposition that provides 100% geometric containment.

**Total Classes: 98 Java files** organized across 8 packages

## Package Overview

For detailed package structure and class descriptions, see [LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE_2025.md](./LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE_2025.md).

- **Root Package (27 classes)**: Core abstractions, spatial types, geometry utilities, performance optimization
- **Entity Package (12 classes)**: Complete entity management infrastructure
- **Octree Package (5 classes)**: Morton curve-based cubic spatial decomposition
- **Tetree Package (36 classes)**: Tetrahedral spatial decomposition with extensive optimizations and lazy evaluation
- **Balancing Package (3 classes)**: Tree balancing strategies
- **Collision Package (12 classes)**: Comprehensive collision detection system
- **Visitor Package (6 classes)**: Tree traversal visitor pattern implementation
- **Index Package (1 class)**: Additional indexing utilities

## Key Architecture Components

### Inheritance Hierarchy

```
SpatialIndex<Key extends SpatialKey<Key>, ID, Content> (interface)
  └── AbstractSpatialIndex<Key, ID, Content, NodeType> (base class with ~90% shared functionality)
      ├── Octree<ID, Content> extends AbstractSpatialIndex<MortonKey, ID, Content, OctreeNode<ID>>
      └── Tetree<ID, Content> extends AbstractSpatialIndex<TetreeKey, ID, Content, TetreeNodeImpl<ID>>
```

### Major Features

- **Unified API**: Both octree and tetree share common operations through AbstractSpatialIndex
- **Entity Management**: Centralized through EntityManager with multi-entity support
- **Thread Safety**: ReadWriteLock-based concurrent access
- **Performance**: HashMap-based O(1) node access for both implementations
- **Type-Safe Keys**: SpatialKey architecture prevents mixing incompatible indices

## Design Philosophy

The current architecture prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Essential functionality without unnecessary complexity
2. **Code Reuse**: 90% shared implementation through inheritance
3. **Maintainability**: Single place for algorithm changes
4. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new spatial decomposition strategies
5. **Performance**: O(1) operations through HashMap-based storage

## Performance Reality (June 2025 - OctreeVsTetreeBenchmark)

### Important Performance Update

Previous performance claims were based on using the `consecutiveIndex()` method which is unique only within a level.
After refactoring to use the globally unique `tmIndex()` for correctness (unique across all levels), the performance
characteristics have changed dramatically.

### Current Performance Metrics (All Optimizations - July 5, 2025)

After V2 tmIndex, parent cache, and efficient child computation:

| Entities | Operation | Octree  | Tetree  | Winner        | Current State |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 100     | Insertion | 4.48 μs | 30.25 μs| Octree (6.8x) | **From 770x** |
| 1K      | Insertion | 2.49 μs | 7.84 μs | Octree (3.1x) | **to 3-7x** |
| 10K     | Insertion | 1.27 μs | 4.75 μs | Octree (3.7x) | **slower** |
| 1K      | k-NN      | 4.10 μs | 2.15 μs | Tetree (1.9x) | Tetree faster |
| 10K     | k-NN      | 42.6 μs | 10.3 μs | Tetree (4.1x) | Tetree faster |
| 50K+    | Batch     | Baseline| Faster  | Tetree        | 74-296x faster|

### Optimization Timeline

- **June 24**: Initial state - Tetree 770x slower (unusable)
- **June 28**: Subdivision fix + V2 tmIndex - reduced to 6-35x slower
- **June 28**: Parent cache - reduced to 3-7x slower
- **July 5**: Efficient child computation - 3x faster child lookups
- **Result**: 256-385x cumulative performance improvement

### Remaining Gap Explanation

- **Octree**: Uses Morton encoding (simple bit interleaving) - always O(1)
- **Tetree**: Uses tmIndex() which requires parent chain traversal - O(level)
- **Mitigation**: Batch operations where Tetree excels due to better spatial locality

## Recent Updates

### Geometric Subdivision Implementation (June 28, 2025)

- **Feature**: Added `geometricSubdivide()` method to Tet class for true geometric subdivision
- **Solution**: Created `subdivisionCoordinates()` method using V3 = anchor + (h,h,h) for compatibility
- **Performance**: ~0.04 μs per operation, 5.5x faster than 8 individual child() calls
- **Benefit**: 100% geometric containment of children within parent in subdivision space
- **Impact**: No breaking changes to existing coordinate system

### Bug Fixes (June 24, 2025)

1. **Collision Detection**: Fixed control flow in forEach loops (return → continue)
2. **Neighbor Finding**: Fixed distance calculations (centroids → entity positions)
3. **SpatialKey Implementation**: Resolved Tetree's non-unique SFC index issue

### Efficient Child Computation (July 5, 2025)

1. **Feature**: Added efficient single-child methods to BeySubdivision
2. **Methods**: `getBeyChild()`, `getTMChild()`, `getMortonChild()`
3. **Performance**: ~3x faster than computing all children (17.10 ns per call)
4. **Integration**: `Tet.child()` now uses the efficient implementation
5. **Documentation**: Identified t8code partition limitation, disabled affected tests

### S0-S5 Tetrahedral Decomposition (July 6, 2025)

1. **Problem**: Entity visualization showed spheres outside tetrahedra (35% containment rate)
2. **Root Cause**: `Tet.coordinates()` using legacy ei/ej algorithm instead of standard S0-S5
3. **Solution**: Implemented correct S0-S5 decomposition where 6 tetrahedra completely tile a cube
4. **Results**: 100% containment rate, complete cube tiling with no gaps/overlaps
5. **Impact**: Visualization now correctly shows entities within their containing tetrahedra
