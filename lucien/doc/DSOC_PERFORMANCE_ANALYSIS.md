# DSOC Performance Analysis Report

**Date**: July 25, 2025  
**Analysis Scope**: Dynamic Spatiotemporal Occlusion Culling (DSOC) Performance Issues  
**Test Environment**: DSOCPerformanceTest results on macOS ARM64 with Java 23  

## Executive Summary

The DSOC optimization system is currently producing significant performance degradation instead of the intended speedup. Across all test scenarios, DSOC-enabled frustum culling is **2.6x to 11x slower** than baseline frustum culling, with the worst performance occurring in small entity count scenarios.

### Key Observations

1. **Worst performance at small scales**: 1,000 entity scenarios show 3-11x slowdown
2. **Better relative performance at larger scales**: 50,000 entity scenarios show minimal 1.1x slowdown
3. **TBV system not activating**: All tests show 0 active TBVs and NaN% hit rates
4. **Occlusion rate consistent**: ~31% occlusion rate regardless of test configuration
5. **Performance gap decreases with entity count**: Overhead becomes proportionally smaller

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. TBV System Completely Inactive

The Temporal Bounding Volume (TBV) system shows:
- **Active TBVs**: 0 across all tests
- **TBV Hit Rate**: NaN% (no valid measurements)
- **Cause**: TBVs require entity movement/velocity to activate, but test scenarios use static entities

### 2. Pure Overhead from Hierarchical Z-Buffer Operations

The performance cost comes from:

#### a) HierarchicalZBuffer Overhead
- **Multi-level Z-buffer allocation**: 1024x1024 buffers across 6 pyramid levels
- **Buffer clearing**: Every frame clears all pyramid levels
- **Matrix computations**: View-projection matrix multiplication per frame
- **Memory allocation**: ~6MB of Z-buffer data per spatial index instance

#### b) Occlusion Testing Overhead  
- **Per-entity occlusion tests**: Additional `zBuffer.isOccluded()` calls for every entity
- **Bounds computation**: `computeNodeBounds()` called for every node
- **Projection calculations**: 3D bounds projected to screen space for every test

#### c) DSOC Code Path Complexity
- **Additional conditional checks**: `isDSOCEnabled()` checks throughout traversal
- **OcclusionAwareSpatialNode casting**: Runtime type checking and casting
- **Statistics tracking**: Atomic counter increments for every operation

### 3. No Effective Occlusion Culling Benefit

Despite 31.2% occlusion rates reported, the system provides no performance benefit because:
- **Test scene lacks effective occluders**: Random entity distribution doesn't create meaningful occlusion
- **Small occluder count**: Only 1-9 occluders vs 1,000-50,000 entities
- **Inadequate occluder geometry**: Thin box occluders (±50x±50x±10) provide minimal occlusion

### 4. Algorithm Complexity Mismatch

The DSOC system adds O(n) overhead to every entity test, but provides no algorithmic improvement:
- **Baseline**: O(n) frustum tests 
- **DSOC**: O(n) frustum tests + O(n) occlusion tests + O(1) setup overhead
- **Net result**: ~2x the computational work per entity

## Detailed Performance Breakdown

### Fixed Overhead per Frame
1. **Z-buffer clearing**: ~6 levels × (1024×1024) = 6.3M float operations
2. **Matrix multiplication**: 4×4 matrix multiply for view-projection
3. **Camera parameter setup**: Array copying and validation
4. **Statistics reset**: Atomic counter operations

### Per-Entity Variable Overhead  
1. **Bounds computation**: 3D AABB calculation for every node
2. **Projection to screen space**: 8 vertex transformations per bounds
3. **Hierarchical Z-test**: Multi-level depth buffer lookups
4. **OcclusionAwareSpatialNode operations**: Runtime polymorphism overhead

### Memory Overhead
- **Base Z-buffer**: 1024×1024×4 = 4MB
- **Pyramid levels**: Additional ~2MB for smaller levels
- **Per-index overhead**: ~6MB × 2 (Octree + Tetree) = 12MB total

## Performance Scaling Analysis

### Small Scale (1,000 entities)
- **Fixed overhead dominance**: Setup costs ~0.3-0.4ms exceed entity processing time
- **Poor amortization**: High per-entity overhead not justified by benefits
- **Memory cache pressure**: Large Z-buffers for small working sets

### Medium Scale (10,000 entities)  
- **Improved amortization**: Fixed costs spread across more entities
- **Still overhead-dominated**: Per-entity costs still exceed benefits
- **Memory bandwidth impact**: 12MB working set impacts cache efficiency

### Large Scale (50,000 entities)
- **Best relative performance**: Fixed costs well-amortized
- **Algorithm complexity dominates**: O(n) vs O(n) comparison
- **Memory bandwidth critical**: Large datasets make memory access patterns important

## Occlusion Effectiveness Analysis

### Current Occlusion Rates
- **Measured rate**: 31.2% entities marked as occluded
- **Performance benefit**: Zero (negative performance)
- **Root cause**: False positive occlusion marking without algorithmic improvement

### Scene Configuration Issues
1. **Insufficient occluder density**: 1-9 occluders for 1,000+ entities
2. **Poor occluder placement**: Random distribution reduces systematic occlusion
3. **Inadequate occluder size**: Thin boxes don't block substantial volumes
4. **Missing depth complexity**: Flat random distribution lacks depth-based occlusion

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Disable DSOC by default** until performance issues resolved
2. **Add performance-based auto-disable** when overhead exceeds benefits  
3. **Create separate TBV-focused tests** with actual entity movement
4. **Implement lazy Z-buffer allocation** to reduce memory overhead

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Reduce Z-buffer resolution** for small entity counts (adaptive sizing)
2. **Implement early exit conditions** when no occluders present
3. **Add occlusion effectiveness thresholds** to disable when not beneficial
4. **Optimize hierarchical Z-buffer implementation** (SIMD, reduced precision)

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Algorithmic improvements** to provide O(log n) or better complexity benefits
2. **GPU-accelerated occlusion testing** for large-scale scenarios
3. **Adaptive configuration** based on scene characteristics and performance monitoring
4. **Hybrid approaches** combining spatial and temporal coherence

The DSOC system requires fundamental architectural changes to provide performance benefits rather than degradation.
