# Lucien Module - Project Status

## Overview

The lucien module provides high-performance 3D spatial indexing with both Octree and Tetree implementations. The module is production-ready with comprehensive test coverage and optimized performance.

## Current State

### Core Features âœ…
- **Dual spatial indices**: Octree (cubic) and Tetree (tetrahedral)
- **Multi-entity support**: Multiple entities per spatial location
- **Entity spanning**: Large entities across multiple nodes
- **K-nearest neighbor search**: Optimized for both implementations
- **Range queries**: Efficient spatial region searches
- **Ray intersection**: Fast ray-entity intersection tests
- **Collision detection**: Integrated physics-ready collision system
- **Frustum culling**: Camera-based visibility determination
- **Plane intersection**: Spatial partitioning support

### Architecture
- **Unified base class**: `AbstractSpatialIndex<Key, ID, Content>`
- **Type-safe spatial keys**: `MortonKey` (Octree), `TetreeKey` (Tetree)
- **Centralized entity management**: `EntityManager` handles lifecycle
- **Thread-safe operations**: Fine-grained locking for concurrency
- **Memory pooling**: Efficient node allocation and reuse

### Performance Characteristics

**Octree**
- Insertion: Fast (O(1) Morton encoding)
- Queries: Good performance
- Memory: Higher usage
- Best for: Frequent updates, predictable performance

**Tetree**
- Insertion: Slower (O(level) tmIndex)
- Queries: 2-4x faster than Octree
- Memory: 75-80% reduction
- Best for: Query-heavy, memory-constrained applications

## Recent Improvements

### Phase 6.2 Cleanup (July 10, 2025)
- Eliminated redundant node wrapper classes (unified to `SpatialNodeImpl`)
- Fixed k-NN search for multi-level entities
- Improved search radius expansion algorithm
- Reduced generic parameters from 4 to 3

### Performance Optimizations (June-July 2025)
- Lazy evaluation for range queries (99.5% memory reduction)
- Parent caching (17.3x speedup)
- V2 tmIndex algorithm (4x speedup)
- Bulk operations support (15.5x speedup)

## Known Limitations

1. **Tetree insertion performance**: O(level) tmIndex computation creates 15x gap vs Octree
2. **Coordinate constraints**: Entities must have positive coordinates
3. **T8code partition**: Tetree doesn't perfectly partition space (fundamental limitation)

## Next Steps

The module is feature-complete and optimized. Future work may include:
- Alternative tetrahedral indexing strategies
- GPU acceleration for specific operations
- Distributed spatial indexing support
