# Lucien Module - Project Status

## Overview

The lucien module provides high-performance 3D spatial indexing with both Octree and Tetree implementations. The module
is production-ready with comprehensive test coverage and optimized performance.

## Current State

### Core Features âœ…

- **Dual spatial indices**: Octree (cubic) and Tetree (tetrahedral)
- **Multi-entity support**: Multiple entities per spatial location
- **Entity spanning**: Large entities across multiple nodes
- **K-nearest neighbor search**: Optimized for both implementations
- **Range queries**: Efficient spatial region searches
- **Ray intersection**: Fast ray-entity intersection tests
- **Collision detection**: Integrated physics-ready collision system
- **Frustum culling**: Camera-based visibility determination
- **Plane intersection**: Spatial partitioning support

### Architecture

- **Unified base class**: `AbstractSpatialIndex<Key, ID, Content>`
- **Type-safe spatial keys**: `MortonKey` (Octree), `TetreeKey` (Tetree)
- **Centralized entity management**: `EntityManager` handles lifecycle
- **Thread-safe operations**: Fine-grained locking for concurrency
- **Memory pooling**: Efficient node allocation and reuse

### Performance Characteristics

**Octree**

- Insertion: O(1) Morton encoding (now slower due to concurrent structures)
- Queries: Better k-NN performance at scale (>10K entities)
- Memory: Higher usage (100% baseline)
- Best for: k-NN at scale, high-frequency updates at 10K+ entities

**Tetree**

- Insertion: 2.1x to 6.2x faster than Octree (after concurrent optimizations)
- Queries: 1.1-1.6x faster k-NN at low counts, 2.5-3.8x faster range queries
- Memory: Uses 65-73% of Octree's memory
- Best for: General use, insertion-heavy workloads, range queries

## Recent Improvements

### Logging and Tree ID Cleanup (July 12, 2025)

- Replaced System.out/err with proper SLF4J logging in implementation classes
- Created TestOutputSuppressor utility for conditional test output (VERBOSE_TESTS env var)
- Fixed tree ID generation to use SHA-256 hashing with Base64 encoding
- Resolved excessive tree name concatenation issue (Child_Child_Child_...)
- All Forest tests passing with new hash-based tree IDs

### Forest Implementation Completion (July 11, 2025)

- **AdaptiveForest**: Dynamic density-based subdivision/merging with multiple strategies
- **HierarchicalForest**: Multi-level LOD management with distance-based entity promotion
- Fixed all compilation errors in forest implementations
- 115 forest tests across 13 test classes all passing
- Updated performance documentation to reflect latest benchmarks

### Concurrent Optimizations (July 11, 2025)

- Replaced dual HashMap/TreeSet with ConcurrentSkipListMap
- 54-61% memory reduction, eliminated ConcurrentModificationException
- Performance reversal: Tetree now 2.1-6.2x faster for insertions
- Extended ObjectPools to all allocation hot spots

### Phase 6.2 Cleanup (July 10, 2025)

- Eliminated redundant node wrapper classes (unified to `SpatialNodeImpl`)
- Fixed k-NN search for multi-level entities
- Improved search radius expansion algorithm
- Reduced generic parameters from 4 to 3

### Performance Optimizations (June-July 2025)

- Lazy evaluation for range queries (99.5% memory reduction)
- Parent caching (17.3x speedup)
- V2 tmIndex algorithm (4x speedup)
- Bulk operations support (15.5x speedup)

## Known Limitations

1. **Performance reversal**: ConcurrentSkipListMap made Tetree faster for insertions despite O(level) tmIndex
2. **Coordinate constraints**: Entities must have positive coordinates
3. **T8code partition**: Tetree doesn't perfectly partition space (fundamental limitation)

## Next Steps

The module is feature-complete and optimized. Future work may include:

- Alternative tetrahedral indexing strategies
- GPU acceleration for specific operations
- Distributed spatial indexing support
