# Tetree locate() Algorithm Fix: Resolving Visualization Containment Issues

## Executive Summary

The TetreeVisualizationDemo shows entities appearing outside their containing tetrahedra despite implementing correct S0-S5 cube decomposition. Root cause analysis reveals a **fundamental algorithm mismatch** between the geometric S0-S5 coordinates and the point location method. This document details the problem and implementation plan for the fix.

## Problem Analysis

### Current State
- ✅ **S0-S5 coordinates() is correct** - Tetrahedra perfectly tile cube with 100% coverage
- ✅ **containsUltraFast() works correctly** - Proper geometric containment testing
- ❌ **locate() method is flawed** - Uses non-deterministic "first match" algorithm
- ❌ **Visualization shows misplaced entities** - Entities appear outside their containers

### Root Cause: Algorithm Mismatch

The issue lies in `Tetree.locate()` (lines 2755-2760):

```java
for (byte type = 0; type < 6; type++) {
    Tet candidateTet = new Tet(anchorX, anchorY, anchorZ, level, type);
    if (candidateTet.contains(point)) {
        return candidateTet;  // Returns FIRST match, not necessarily correct one
    }
}
```

**Problems with this approach:**
1. **Non-deterministic**: Returns first tetrahedron that contains point
2. **Boundary ambiguity**: Points near faces may be contained by multiple tetrahedra
3. **Inconsistent assignment**: Same point could get different tetrahedron depending on iteration order
4. **Mismatch with S0-S5**: Doesn't respect the canonical S0-S5 decomposition

### Impact
- Entity gets assigned to wrong tetrahedron type (e.g., type 2 instead of type 5)
- Visualization renders entity sphere in one location (correct position)
- But shows containing tetrahedron in different location (wrong type)
- Result: Entity appears "outside" its container

## Solution Design

### New Algorithm: Deterministic Geometric Classification

Replace the "test all 6" approach with a **deterministic geometric algorithm** that directly computes which S0-S5 tetrahedron should contain a point.

#### Key Principles
1. **Deterministic**: Same point always returns same tetrahedron
2. **Geometric**: Based on point's position within the cube
3. **S0-S5 compliant**: Respects the standard cube decomposition
4. **Efficient**: Direct calculation instead of 6-way testing

#### Mathematical Foundation

The S0-S5 decomposition divides a cube into 6 tetrahedra based on geometric regions:

```
Cube vertices (h=1):
V0=(0,0,0), V1=(1,0,0), V2=(0,1,0), V3=(1,1,0)
V4=(0,0,1), V5=(1,0,1), V6=(0,1,1), V7=(1,1,1)

S0: V0,V1,V3,V7 - "front-right" region
S1: V0,V2,V3,V7 - "front-left" region  
S2: V0,V4,V5,V7 - "back-right" region
S3: V0,V4,V6,V7 - "back-left" region
S4: V0,V1,V5,V7 - "bottom-right" region
S5: V0,V2,V6,V7 - "bottom-left" region
```

All tetrahedra share V0 (origin) and V7 (opposite corner).

#### Classification Algorithm

The key insight is that the S0-S5 decomposition creates distinct geometric regions within the cube:

```java
private byte classifyPointInCube(float x, float y, float z) {
    // Point coordinates normalized to [0,1] within cube
    
    // Primary classification: diagonal split
    if (x + y + z <= 1.5) {
        // Lower diagonal half - tetrahedra closer to origin
        if (x <= y && x <= z) return 3; // S3: minimal x
        if (y <= x && y <= z) return 2; // S2: minimal y  
        return 4; // S4: minimal z
    } else {
        // Upper diagonal half - tetrahedra closer to opposite corner
        if (x >= y && x >= z) return 0; // S0: maximal x
        if (y >= x && y >= z) return 1; // S1: maximal y
        return 5; // S5: maximal z
    }
}
```

This algorithm ensures:
- **Partition completeness**: Every point gets exactly one tetrahedron
- **Deterministic assignment**: Same point always returns same type
- **Geometric consistency**: Matches the S0-S5 decomposition structure
