    .withOverlappingTrees(false)
    .withGhostZones(true, 0.1f);

Forest<MortonKey, Long, Entity> forest = new Forest<>(config);

// Add trees for different regions
for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
    for (int y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
        Vector3f origin = new Vector3f(x * 100, y * 100, 0);
        Vector3f size = new Vector3f(100, 100, 100);
        Octree tree = new Octree(origin, size);
        forest.addTree(tree, new BoundingBox(origin, size));
    }
}
```

### Distributed Simulation
```java
// Create forest with spatial decomposition
int numTrees = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
Forest<TetreeKey, UUID, Particle> forest = 
    GridForest.createUniformGrid(origin, totalSize, numTrees, 1, 1);

// Parallel update
forest.parallelUpdate(particle -> {
    particle.updatePosition(deltaTime);
    return particle.getPosition();
});
