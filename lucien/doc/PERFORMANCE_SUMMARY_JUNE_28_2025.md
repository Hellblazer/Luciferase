# Spatial Index Performance Summary - June 28, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the latest performance benchmarks for Octree and Tetree spatial indices based on comprehensive testing with OctreeVsTetreeBenchmark.

## Key Performance Metrics

### Insertion Performance
| Entity Count | Octree | Tetree | Performance Ratio |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 100 | 3.32 μs/entity | 28.59 μs/entity | Octree **8.6x faster** |
| 1,000 | 2.51 μs/entity | 7.64 μs/entity | Octree **3.0x faster** |
| 10,000 | 1.06 μs/entity | 4.68 μs/entity | Octree **4.4x faster** |

**Winner**: Octree - consistently faster due to O(1) Morton encoding vs O(level) tmIndex computation

### k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Search
| Entity Count | Octree | Tetree | Performance Ratio |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 100 | 0.75 μs | 0.38 μs | Tetree **2.0x faster** |
| 1,000 | 4.08 μs | 1.61 μs | Tetree **2.5x faster** |
| 10,000 | 37.61 μs | 10.70 μs | Tetree **3.5x faster** |

**Winner**: Tetree - superior spatial locality in tetrahedral decomposition

### Range Query Performance
| Entity Count | Octree | Tetree | Performance Ratio |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 100 | 0.39 μs | 0.52 μs | Octree **1.3x faster** |
| 1,000 | 2.12 μs | 4.02 μs | Octree **1.9x faster** |
| 10,000 | 21.59 μs | 53.24 μs | Octree **2.5x faster** |

**Winner**: Octree - simpler AABB calculations benefit range searches

### Update Performance
| Entity Count | Octree | Tetree | Performance Ratio |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 100 | 0.14 μs | 0.07 μs | Tetree **2.0x faster** |
| 1,000 | 0.003 μs | 0.008 μs | Octree **3.2x faster** |
| 10,000 | 0.002 μs | 0.005 μs | Octree **2.3x faster** |

**Winner**: Mixed - depends on dataset size

### Memory Usage
| Entity Count | Octree | Tetree | Tetree Memory % |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| 100 | 0.15 MB | 0.04 MB | **28.7%** |
| 1,000 | 1.40 MB | 0.34 MB | **24.0%** |
| 10,000 | 12.90 MB | 3.16 MB | **24.5%** |

**Winner**: Tetree - consistently uses 70-75% less memory

## Performance With Optimizations

### Bulk Loading Impact (BaselinePerformanceBenchmark)
| Entity Count | Octree Basic | Octree Bulk | Tetree Basic | Tetree Bulk |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1,000 | 9 ms | 4 ms | 17 ms | 3 ms |
| 10,000 | 21 ms | 11 ms | 60 ms | 15 ms |
| 50,000 | 62 ms | 83 ms | 1,126 ms | 56 ms |
| 100,000 | 154 ms | 173 ms | 3,730 ms | 97 ms |

**Key Finding**: Tetree benefits dramatically from bulk loading (up to 38x speedup)

## Recommendations

### Use Octree When:
- **Write-heavy workloads** - Frequent insertions and updates
- **Real-time applications** - Games, simulations with moving objects
- **Range queries** - Spatial database applications
- **Balanced workloads** - Mix of insertions and queries

### Use Tetree When:
- **Read-heavy workloads** - Static datasets with frequent queries
- **Memory-constrained** - Embedded systems, mobile devices
- **k-NN queries** - Neighbor search applications
- **Bulk loading** - Can leverage optimizations for initial data load

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental performance difference stems from:

1. **Octree**: Uses Morton encoding (simple bit interleaving) - O(1) operation
2. **Tetree**: Uses tmIndex() requiring parent chain traversal - O(level) operation

This algorithmic difference cannot be optimized away and explains the persistent insertion performance gap.

## Optimization Strategies

### For Tetree Performance:
1. **Enable bulk loading** - Defers expensive operations
2. **Use lazy evaluation** - Postpone tmIndex computation
3. **Batch operations** - Amortize overhead across multiple insertions
4. **Pre-sort data** - Improve spatial locality

### For Both Implementations:
1. **Tune node capacity** - Balance tree depth vs node density
2. **Use appropriate data structures** - HashMap for O(1) access
3. **Enable parallel operations** - For bulk processing
4. **Monitor performance** - Use built-in metrics

## Conclusion

Both spatial indices excel in different scenarios:
- **Octree**: General-purpose spatial indexing with balanced performance
- **Tetree**: Specialized for query-intensive, memory-constrained applications

The choice depends on your specific requirements for insertion speed, query performance, and memory usage.
