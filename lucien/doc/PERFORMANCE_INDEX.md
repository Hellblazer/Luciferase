## Quick Reference

### For Different Workloads

**Insertion-Heavy**: Use Tetree (1.8x to 5.7x faster than Octree)
**Range Query-Heavy**: Use Octree (3.2x to 8.3x faster than Tetree)
**k-NN Search**: Use Tetree for small/medium datasets, Octree for >10K entities
**Memory-Constrained**: Memory usage nearly converged (Tetree uses 80-99% of Octree's memory)
**Update-Heavy**: Use Tetree (1.7x to 3.0x faster than Octree)
**Batch Loading**: Use Tetree with bulk operations
**Anisotropic Data**: Use Prism for directional data patterns
**High Occlusion Scenes**: Enable DSOC for up to 2.0x speedup

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Three-way comparison (Octree vs Tetree vs Prism)
mvn test -Dtest=OctreeVsTetreeBenchmark

# Prism-specific benchmarks
mvn test -Dtest=*PrismPerformanceTest

# Anisotropic workload testing
mvn test -Dtest=*AnisotropicTest

# Quick validation
mvn test -Dtest=QuickPerformanceTest

# Full suite
mvn test -Dtest=*PerformanceTest

# DSOC performance tests (gated)
export RUN_DSOC_PERF_TESTS=true
mvn test -Dtest=DSOCPerformanceTest
