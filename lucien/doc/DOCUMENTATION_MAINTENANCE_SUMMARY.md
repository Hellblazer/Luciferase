## Documentation Structure

### Core Architecture Documents
- **LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete architecture reference
- **ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md** - High-level overview
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Current development status

### API Documentation (13 documents)
- Core APIs: Spatial Index, Entity Management, Bulk Operations
- Query APIs: K-NN, Ray, Plane, Frustum
- Advanced APIs: Collision, Lock-Free, Tree Traversal, Tree Balancing
- Forest API: Multi-tree coordination
- **NEW**: Prism API for anisotropic decomposition

### Performance Documentation
- **PERFORMANCE_INDEX.md** - Guide to all performance docs
- **PERFORMANCE_TRACKING.md** - Current baseline and history
- **SPATIAL_INDEX_PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md** - Three-way comparison (includes Prism)

### Implementation Guides
- **TETREE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Tetrahedral implementation
- **PRISM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Triangular prism implementation
- **S0_S5_TETRAHEDRAL_DECOMPOSITION.md** - Geometric details

## Documentation Standards

### Tone and Style
- Professional, matter-of-fact tone
- Avoid promotional language and exclamation marks
- Use measured claims and factual descriptions
- No bold emphasis on performance metrics

### Content Requirements
- Accurate technical details
- Complete code examples
- Current performance metrics
- Clear cross-references

### Maintenance Guidelines
1. Update performance metrics after each optimization
2. Keep API documentation synchronized with code changes
3. Archive outdated documents to `lucien/archived/`
4. Maintain index files for easy navigation

## Document Health Status

### Up-to-Date ‚úÖ
- All Prism documentation (July 12, 2025)
- All Forest documentation (July 11, 2025)
- Performance documentation (July 12, 2025)
- Core API documentation (current)

### Needs Review üîç
- None currently - all documents recently updated

### Archived üì¶
- 9 completed/outdated documents in `lucien/archived/`
- Legacy ei/ej algorithm references removed
- Historical implementation plans preserved

## Cross-Reference Integrity

All documents have been verified for:
- Correct file path references
- Valid internal links
- Consistent naming conventions
- Accurate performance metrics

## Next Maintenance Tasks

1. Update performance documentation after Prism Phase 2 completion
2. Add Prism-specific performance benchmarks to SPATIAL_INDEX_PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md
3. Create specialized Prism implementation guide after Phase 3
4. Monitor and update progress tracker weekly during Prism development
