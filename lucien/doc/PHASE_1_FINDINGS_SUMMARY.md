# Phase 1 Findings Summary: Foundation Analysis

## Phase 1.1: Vertex Computation Analysis ✓

### Key Findings

1. **Vertex Formula**: Each tetrahedron type (0-5) uses a specific pattern:
   - `ei = type / 2` (primary axis)
   - `ej = (ei + ((type % 2 == 0) ? 2 : 1)) % 3` (secondary axis)
   - Vertices positioned at cube corners based on these axes

2. **Vertex Positions**:
   - V0: Always at anchor (x, y, z)
   - V1: Anchor + h in dimension ei
   - V2: Anchor + h in dimensions ei and ej
   - V3: Anchor + h in dimensions (ei+1)%3 and (ei+2)%3

3. **Volume**: Each tetrahedron has volume h³/6 (exactly 1/6 of containing cube)

### Child Vertex Assignments

Based on CHILD_VERTEX_PARENT_VERTEX table:

**Corner Children (1-4)**:
- Child 1: [V0, M01, M02, Center] - anchored at parent vertex 0
- Child 2: [M01, V1, M12, Center] - anchored at parent vertex 1
- Child 3: [M02, M12, V2, Center] - anchored at parent vertex 2
- Child 4: [M03, M13, M23, V3] - anchored at parent vertex 3

**Octahedral Children (0, 5-7)**:
- Child 0: [M01, M02, M03, Center]
- Child 5: [Center, M02, M03, M23]
- Child 6: [M01, Center, M13, M12]
- Child 7: [Center, M23, M13, M12]

### Edge Midpoint Numbering

The reference points 4-9 correspond to:
- 4: M01 (edge 0-1 midpoint)
- 5: M02 (edge 0-2 midpoint)
- 6: M03 (edge 0-3 midpoint)
- 7: M12 (edge 1-2 midpoint)
- 8: M13 (edge 1-3 midpoint)
- 9: M23 (edge 2-3 midpoint)

### The Center Point (Reference 10)

The documentation indicates this is a "center" but doesn't specify exactly what center:
- Most likely the centroid of the parent tetrahedron
- Could be the center of the octahedron formed by edge midpoints
- Used to split the octahedron into 4 tetrahedra

### Parent Type Dependency

The INDEX_TO_BEY_NUMBER table shows different child arrangements for each parent type, affecting:
- Which child index maps to which Bey ID
- The spatial orientation of the octahedral splitting
- The final child type assignments

## Phase 1.3: Bey Refinement Mathematics ✓

### Core Concepts

1. **Edge-based Subdivision**: New vertices placed at edge midpoints
2. **Octahedron Formation**: The 6 edge midpoints form an octahedron
3. **Splitting Choice**: The octahedron can be split along 3 different axes
4. **8 Children Total**: 4 corner + 4 from octahedron

### The Missing Piece

The exact geometric construction requires:
1. Computing actual edge midpoints in 3D space
2. Determining the center point precisely
3. Assembling children using the vertex assignments
4. Ensuring all children are inside parent

## Critical Insight for Phase 2

The current `child()` method computes grid positions, NOT geometric subdivision. We need:

1. **Geometric Vertices**: Get actual tetrahedron vertices using `coordinates()`
2. **Edge Midpoints**: Compute (V_i + V_j) / 2 for all 6 edges
3. **Center Point**: Likely (V0 + V1 + V2 + V3) / 4
4. **Child Assembly**: Use CHILD_VERTEX_PARENT_VERTEX to build each child
5. **Grid Mapping**: Find best grid position for geometric children

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Design `GeometricSubdivision` class structure
2. Implement edge midpoint calculation
3. Determine center point definition
4. Create child assembly algorithm
5. Design grid-fitting strategy
