# Luciferase Performance Summary - July 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the latest performance optimizations and benchmarks for July 2025, including spatial index improvements, collision system performance baseline, and lazy evaluation implementation.

## New Optimizations

### Efficient Single-Child Computation (July 5, 2025)

#### Problem
The original `Tet.child()` method computed all 8 children internally even when only one was needed, leading to unnecessary calculations during tree traversal and path-following operations.

#### Solution
Implemented three new efficient methods in `BeySubdivision`:
- `getBeyChild(parent, beyIndex)` - Computes single child in Bey order
- `getTMChild(parent, tmIndex)` - Computes single child in TM order
- `getMortonChild(parent, mortonIndex)` - Computes single child in Morton order

#### Performance Results

| Operation | Old Implementation | New Implementation | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Single child computation | ~51.91 ns | ~17.10 ns | 3.03x faster |
| Throughput | 19.3M calls/sec | 58.5M calls/sec | 3.03x improvement |

#### Benefits
1. **Reduced Computation**: Only calculates the midpoints needed for the requested child
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoids creating unnecessary intermediate objects
3. **Cache Friendly**: Better locality of reference for single-child operations
4. **Backward Compatible**: `Tet.child()` now uses the efficient method internally

### Integration Impact

The optimization has been integrated into the core `Tet.child()` method, providing automatic performance benefits to:
- Tree traversal algorithms
- Path-finding operations
- Subdivision queries
- Any code using single-child lookups

### Lazy Evaluation for Tetree Ranges (July 8, 2025)

#### Problem
Tetree range queries could create millions of TetreeKey instances in memory, each requiring O(level) tmIndex() computation, leading to memory exhaustion for large spatial queries.

#### Solution
Implemented lazy evaluation pattern with:
- `LazyRangeIterator` - O(1) memory iterator regardless of range size
- `LazySFCRangeStream` - Stream API integration with Spliterator support
- `RangeHandle` - Deferred computation for spatial range queries
- `RangeQueryVisitor` - Tree-based traversal with early termination

#### Performance Results

| Metric | Eager Evaluation | Lazy Evaluation | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Memory (6M keys) | ~4.1 GB | ~8 KB | 99.5% reduction |
| Memory per key | ~680 bytes | O(1) constant | N/A |
| Early termination (100 of 50K) | 142 ms | 0.8 ms | 177x faster |
| Stream operations | O(n) memory | O(1) memory | Unbounded |

#### Benefits
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Constant memory usage enables unbounded range queries
2. **Early Termination**: Stop iteration as soon as desired results found
3. **Stream Integration**: Full Java Stream API support with lazy semantics
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

## Updated Octree vs Tetree Performance (July 8, 2025)

Latest benchmark results with all optimizations:

### 10,000 Entity Benchmark
| Operation | Octree | Tetree | Tetree/Octree | Winner |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Insertion | 1.004 μs/op | 15.330 μs/op | 15.3x | Octree |
| K-NN Search | 20.942 μs/op | 6.089 μs/op | 0.29x | Tetree (3.4x faster) |
| Range Query | 22.641 μs/op | 5.931 μs/op | 0.26x | Tetree (3.8x faster) |
| Update | 0.002 μs/op | 0.033 μs/op | 15.3x | Octree |
| Memory | 13.59 MB | 2.89 MB | 21.3% | Tetree |

### Optimization Impact
| Operation | Before Optimizations | After Optimizations | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Child lookup | ~52 ns | ~17 ns | 3x faster |
| Tree traversal | 3-5x slower | 2-3x slower | 33-40% improvement |
| Range queries (large) | O(n) memory | O(1) memory | 99.5% memory reduction |
| Early termination | Not possible | 177x faster | New capability |

## Known Limitations

### T8Code Partition Issue (Ongoing)
- T8code's tetrahedral connectivity tables do not properly partition the unit cube
- ~48% gaps and ~32% overlaps remain in the decomposition
- This is a fundamental limitation of t8code's approach, not fixed by our S0-S5 coordinate update
- Several containment tests remain disabled due to this limitation
- The S0-S5 fix improved our vertex coordinates but didn't change t8code's subdivision rules
- See `TETREE_T8CODE_PARTITION_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed analysis

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Batch Child Generation**: When multiple children are needed, use the full `subdivide()` method
2. **Child Caching**: For frequently accessed children, consider caching at the parent level
3. **SIMD Operations**: Potential for vectorized midpoint calculations
4. **Parallel Subdivision**: Multi-threaded child generation for bulk operations

## Collision System Performance Baseline (July 7, 2025)

| Sphere vs Sphere | 44 ns | 22.7M checks/sec |
| Capsule vs Capsule | 45 ns | 22.2M checks/sec |
| Box vs Box | 53 ns | 18.9M checks/sec |
| Oriented Box vs OBB | 93 ns | 10.8M checks/sec |

| Swept Sphere vs Capsule | 105 ns | 9.5M checks/sec |
| Conservative Advancement | 844 ns | 1.2M checks/sec |

### Spatial Index Integration
- 1000 entities with custom shapes: 9ms insertion, 65ms for all collisions
- Individual collision checks: < 1 μs with spatial partitioning
- 0.7% collision rate in typical scenarios

See `COLLISION_SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE_REPORT_2025.md` for detailed metrics.

## Conclusion

The July 2025 updates demonstrate strong performance across multiple systems:
1. **Spatial Index**: 3x improvement in Tetree child computation
2. **Collision Detection**: 10-37 million discrete checks per second
3. **CCD**: 1.2-11.4 million continuous collision checks per second
4. **Ray Casting**: 27-37 million intersections per second

These optimizations make Luciferase suitable for real-time physics simulations and interactive 3D applications.
