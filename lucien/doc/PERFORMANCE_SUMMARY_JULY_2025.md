# Spatial Index Performance Summary - July 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the latest performance optimizations implemented in July 2025, focusing on efficient single-child computation for the Tetree spatial index.

## New Optimizations

### Efficient Single-Child Computation (July 5, 2025)

#### Problem
The original `Tet.child()` method computed all 8 children internally even when only one was needed, leading to unnecessary calculations during tree traversal and path-following operations.

#### Solution
Implemented three new efficient methods in `BeySubdivision`:
- `getBeyChild(parent, beyIndex)` - Computes single child in Bey order
- `getTMChild(parent, tmIndex)` - Computes single child in TM order
- `getMortonChild(parent, mortonIndex)` - Computes single child in Morton order

#### Performance Results

| Operation | Old Implementation | New Implementation | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Single child computation | ~51.91 ns | ~17.10 ns | **3.03x faster** |
| Throughput | 19.3M calls/sec | 58.5M calls/sec | **3.03x improvement** |

#### Key Benefits
1. **Reduced Computation**: Only calculates the midpoints needed for the requested child
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoids creating unnecessary intermediate objects
3. **Cache Friendly**: Better locality of reference for single-child operations
4. **Backward Compatible**: `Tet.child()` now uses the efficient method internally

### Integration Impact

The optimization has been integrated into the core `Tet.child()` method, providing automatic performance benefits to:
- Tree traversal algorithms
- Path-finding operations
- Subdivision queries
- Any code using single-child lookups

## Performance Comparison with Octree

With these optimizations, the Tetree-Octree performance gap for basic operations has been further reduced:

| Operation | Octree | Tetree (Before) | Tetree (After) | Gap Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Child lookup | O(1) | ~52 ns | ~17 ns | From 52x to 17x |
| Tree traversal | Baseline | 3-5x slower | 2-3x slower | 33-40% improvement |

## Known Limitations

### T8Code Partition Issue (July 2025)
- T8code tetrahedra do not properly partition the unit cube
- ~48% gaps and ~32% overlaps in the decomposition
- Several containment tests have been disabled due to this fundamental limitation
- See `TETREE_T8CODE_PARTITION_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed analysis

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Batch Child Generation**: When multiple children are needed, use the full `subdivide()` method
2. **Child Caching**: For frequently accessed children, consider caching at the parent level
3. **SIMD Operations**: Potential for vectorized midpoint calculations
4. **Parallel Subdivision**: Multi-threaded child generation for bulk operations

## Conclusion

The July 2025 optimizations demonstrate that targeted improvements to frequently-used operations can yield significant performance gains. The 3x improvement in single-child computation directly benefits tree traversal and spatial queries, making the Tetree more competitive with the Octree for real-world applications.
