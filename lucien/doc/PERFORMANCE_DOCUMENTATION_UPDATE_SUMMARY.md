## Key Prism Performance Findings

### Prism vs Octree
- Insertion: 1.42x slower
- K-NN Search: 2.78x slower  
- Memory: 1.22x more
- Range Query: 1.38x slower

### Prism vs Tetree
- Insertion: 4x slower (Tetree is 4x faster)
- K-NN Search: 2.58x slower
- Memory: 1.29x more
- Range Query: 1.29x slower

### Prism Use Cases
- Anisotropic data distributions with directional bias
- Rectangular decomposition matching data patterns
- Streaming or columnar data with natural layering
- Custom subdivision strategies for specific use cases
- Performance requirements between Octree and Tetree
