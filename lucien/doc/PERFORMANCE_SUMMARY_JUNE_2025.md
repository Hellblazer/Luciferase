# Luciferase Performance Summary - June 28, 2025

## Performance Improvements

During June 2025, several optimizations were implemented in the Luciferase spatial indexing system:

### Key Changes

1. **Tetree Bulk Loading Performance**
   - 35-38% faster than Octree at 50K+ entities
   - Crossover point: ~50,000 entities
   - Optimizations integrated into main codebase

2. **V2 tmIndex Optimization**
   - 4x speedup in tmIndex computation
   - Reduced from 0.23 μs to 0.06 μs per call
   - Simplified from 70+ lines to ~15 lines

3. **Parent Cache Implementation**
   - 17-67x speedup for parent operations
   - Critical for deep tree traversals
   - Minimal memory overhead (~120KB total)

4. **Collision System Performance**
   - Sub-microsecond collision checks with spatial indexing
   - Shape support includes Sphere, Box, Capsule, OrientedBox
   - Integration with both Octree and Tetree

## Performance Metrics (June 28, 2025)

### Collision Detection Performance

| Operation | Performance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sphere-Sphere | 32 ns | Fastest collision check |
| Box-Box | 64 ns | SAT algorithm |
| Capsule-Capsule | 70 ns | Composite geometry |
| Oriented Box | 79 ns | Rotation transforms |
| Ray-Sphere | 44 ns | Quadratic formula |
| Ray-Box | 50 ns | Slab method |
| Ray-Capsule | 75 ns | Cylinder + caps |

### Spatial Index Performance at Scale (10K entities)

| Operation | Octree | Tetree | Faster |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Individual Insert | 1.18 μs | 4.78 μs | Octree (4.0x) |
| Bulk Load (50K+) | 82 ms | 53 ms | Tetree (35%) |
| k-NN Search | 37.31 μs | 12.26 μs | Tetree (3.0x) |
| Range Query | 21.70 μs | 192.50 μs | Octree (8.9x) |
| Memory Usage | 12.89 MB | 3.36 MB | Tetree (74% less) |

## Key Optimizations Implemented

1. **Cache Key Collision Fix**
   - Eliminated 74% collision rate in TetreeLevelCache
   - Now 0% collisions with >95% slot utilization

2. **AABB Range Query Caching**
   - 18-19% improvement at small-medium scales
   - Helps with repeated range queries

3. **Subdivision Fix**
   - Proper tree structure maintenance
   - Reduced insertion gap from 770x to 3-5x

4. **SpatialIndexSet**
   - O(1) operations replacing TreeSet
   - Improvement for large datasets

## Production Recommendations

### Choose Octree for:
- Real-time individual insertions
- Range query dominant workloads
- Consistent low-latency requirements
- Balanced operation mix

### Choose Tetree for:
- Bulk loading scenarios (50K+ entities)
- k-NN query intensive applications
- Memory-constrained environments
- Static or slowly changing datasets

### Collision System Best Practices:
1. Use sphere shapes for fast approximate collision
2. Leverage spatial indexing to minimize checks
3. Consider LOD collision shapes for distant objects
4. Cache AABBs when shapes don't change

## Test Coverage & Quality

- 200+ tests passing
- All 6 spatial index components implemented
- Collision shape coverage for all types
- Performance benchmarks documented
- Thread-safe implementation
- ~90% t8code parity achieved

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Parallel Bulk Loading** - May improve Tetree performance further
2. **SIMD Collision Detection** - Hardware acceleration for shapes
3. **Adaptive Tree Balancing** - Dynamic optimization based on data
4. **GPU Acceleration** - For large scale deployments

## Summary

The June 2025 optimizations have improved Tetree performance in bulk loading scenarios. Combined with its memory efficiency and query performance, Tetree is now a viable option for large-scale applications. The collision system provides physics capabilities for both spatial index implementations.
