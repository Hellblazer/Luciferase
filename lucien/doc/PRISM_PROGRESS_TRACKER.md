## Phase 4 Completion Notes

### Final Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- **All 64 prism tests passing** with zero failures  
- **Critical algorithm fixes implemented**:

  - PrismRayIntersector detects rays starting inside prisms correctly
  - Test face numbering expectations corrected to match geometry

### Performance Test Flakiness Investigation
