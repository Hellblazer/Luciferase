# Plane Intersection - Internal Implementation

**Note**: Plane intersection functionality is not part of the public `SpatialIndex` interface. This document describes internal classes that support plane-based geometric operations.

## Overview

The spatial index implementations contain internal support for plane operations through:

- `Plane3D` class - Represents a plane in 3D space
- `PlaneIntersection` class - Utility for plane-related calculations
- Internal methods in concrete implementations (not exposed in public API)

## Internal Classes

### Plane3D

The `Plane3D` class represents an infinite plane in 3D space using the plane equation ax + by + cz + d = 0:

```java
public class Plane3D {
    // Plane is defined by normal vector and distance from origin
    private final Vector3f normal;
    private final float distance;
    
    // Constructor and methods for geometric calculations
    public float distanceToPoint(Point3f point);
    public boolean isPointOnPositiveSide(Point3f point);
}
```

### PlaneIntersection

Internal utility class for plane-related calculations:

```java
public class PlaneIntersection {
    // Static methods for intersection tests
    public static boolean intersectsAABB(Plane3D plane, Point3f min, Point3f max);
    public static PlaneRelation classifyAABB(Plane3D plane, Point3f min, Point3f max);
}
```

## Current Usage

These classes are used internally for:

1. **Frustum Culling** - Frustum planes are tested against spatial nodes
2. **Node Classification** - Determining node relationships to planes
3. **Geometric Utilities** - Supporting other spatial operations

## Future Considerations

While not currently exposed in the public API, plane intersection could be added in future versions for:

- BSP tree operations
- Portal rendering
- Spatial partitioning
- Clipping operations

## Alternative Approaches

For plane-based queries with the current API:

```java
// Use range queries to approximate plane intersection
Spatial.Cube searchRegion = createRegionNearPlane(plane, thickness);
List<ID> nearPlane = spatialIndex.entitiesInRegion(searchRegion);

// Or use ray intersection for specific plane points
Ray3D ray = new Ray3D(planePoint, planeNormal);
List<RayIntersection<ID, Content>> hits = spatialIndex.rayIntersectAll(ray);
```

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Internal `Plane3D` class implemented
- ✅ Internal `PlaneIntersection` utilities implemented
- ❌ Not exposed in public `SpatialIndex` interface
- ❌ No public plane intersection methods available

For applications requiring plane intersection, consider:
1. Using range queries with appropriate bounds
2. Implementing custom logic using ray intersection
3. Accessing entities and testing against planes manually
