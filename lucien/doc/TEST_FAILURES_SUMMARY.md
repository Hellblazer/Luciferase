# Test Failures Summary

## Overview
After fixing the TetreeIterator memory and hanging issues, there are now 15 test failures across the codebase.

## Test Failures by Category

### 1. Tetree Geometry Tests (3 failures)
- **TetrahedralGeometryEdgeCaseTest.testRayInFacePlane**: Ray in face plane should intersect
- **TetrahedralGeometryEdgeCaseTest.testBoundaryPrecision**: Ray at offset should intersect
- **TetrahedralGeometryEdgeCaseTest.testEnhancedVsStandardConsistency**: Distance mismatch (45.033325 vs 0.0)

### 2. Tetree Ray Intersection Tests (2 failures)
- **TetreeRayIntersectionTest.testDifferentLevels**: Expected 2 entities but found 0
- **TetreeRayIntersectionTest.testRayIntersectionAccuracy**: Intersection expectation mismatch

### 3. Tetree Neighbor Tests (2 failures)
- **TetreeVertexNeighborTest.testVertexNeighborsEdgeConsistency**: Missing neighbors from connected edges
- **TetreeVertexNeighborTest.testVertexNeighborComprehensive**: Vertex has fewer neighbors than adjacent faces

### 4. Tetree Core Functionality (4 failures)
- **TetreeTest.testKNearestNeighbors**: Expected 2 neighbors but found 1
- **TetreeConvenienceMethodsTest.testConvenienceMethodsIntegration**: Common ancestor at wrong level
- **LargeEntitySpanningTest.testAdaptiveLevelSelection**: Adaptive level selection not working
- **TetreeEnhancedIteratorTest.testParentChildIterator**: Iterator returns results when it shouldn't

### 5. Collision Detection (1 error, 1 failure)
- **TetreeCollisionEdgeCaseTest.testExtremePositiveCoordinateValues**: IllegalArgumentException - negative coordinates
- **OctreeCollisionIntegrationTest.testStaticVsDynamicCollisions**: Should detect collision after movement

### 6. Deferred Subdivision (2 failures)
- **DeferredSubdivisionManagerTest.testDeferAndProcess**: Expected true but was false
- **DeferredSubdivisionManagerTest.testPriorityBasedProcessing**: Expected true but was false

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. TetreeIterator Changes
The changes to fix the hanging issue in TetreeIterator may have affected:
- Parent-child traversal logic
- Node visiting order
- Iterator state management

### 2. Coordinate Overflow
The error with negative coordinates (-2049, -2049, -2049) suggests integer overflow when calculating child positions in extreme cases.

### 3. Spatial Query Accuracy
Several tests related to ray intersection and neighbor finding are failing, suggesting the iterator changes may have affected spatial query algorithms.

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Revert TetreeIterator changes partially** - Keep the memory fix but restore original traversal logic
2. **Fix coordinate overflow** - Add bounds checking in Tet.child() method
3. **Debug spatial queries** - The iterator changes may have broken assumptions in k-NN and ray intersection algorithms
4. **Review test expectations** - Some tests may have incorrect expectations that were masked by the previous bug

## Priority
1. Fix the coordinate overflow error (blocks test execution)
2. Fix TetreeEnhancedIteratorTest (core functionality)
3. Fix spatial query tests (k-NN, ray intersection)
4. Fix remaining edge case tests
