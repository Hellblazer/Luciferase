## Optimization Opportunities

### Octree
- Already highly optimized with O(1) Morton encoding
- Minor gains possible through better cache utilization
- Consider SIMD optimizations for bulk operations

### Tetree
- Primary bottleneck: tmIndex() parent chain traversal
- Potential optimization: Aggressive caching of parent chains
- Consider level-based indexing to avoid repeated traversals

### Prism
- Triangle SFC computation could benefit from lookup tables
- Batch operations could amortize composite key generation
- Specialized vertical query paths could improve layer operations

## Conclusions

1. **Octree remains the best general-purpose choice** with superior insertion performance and excellent query capabilities

2. **Tetree excels in memory-constrained scenarios** where query performance matters more than insertion speed

3. **Prism fills a specific niche** for anisotropic data with natural vertical stratification, trading memory for specialized query capabilities

4. **All three indices are production-ready** with comprehensive testing, thread-safe operations, and robust error handling

5. **Performance differences are significant but not prohibitive** - choose based on specific application requirements rather than raw performance alone

## Recommendations

1. **Default Choice**: Use Octree unless specific requirements dictate otherwise

2. **Memory Critical**: Choose Tetree if memory usage is the primary constraint

3. **Layered Data**: Select Prism for naturally stratified data where vertical queries are common

4. **Hybrid Approach**: Consider using different indices for different data subsets within the same application

5. **Future Work**: Investigate adaptive index selection based on data characteristics
