# Ghost Functionality Analysis: t8code vs Lucien

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of ghost functionality in t8code and Lucien's implementation. Ghost elements are non-local elements that have neighbor relationships with local elements, enabling parallel computations without explicit communication during computation phases.

**UPDATE (July 2025)**: Lucien has completed a comprehensive ghost implementation that architecturally matches or exceeds t8code in several areas, with full gRPC-based distributed communication infrastructure.
