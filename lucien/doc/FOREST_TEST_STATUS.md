# Forest Test Status Report

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive status report of all forest-related tests in the Lucien project as of July 11, 2025. All forest tests are now passing successfully.

## Fixed Issues

### ForestSpatialQueriesTest.java.disabled

**Status**: ✅ FIXED and ENABLED

**Issue**: The test was disabled due to API compatibility issues with the Frustum3D class.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Test was calling non-existent `frustum.contains()` method instead of `frustum.containsPoint()`
2. Test was attempting to create Frustum3D with array constructors instead of proper factory methods

**Solution**:
1. Updated test to use `frustum.containsPoint(pos)` instead of `frustum.contains(pos)`
2. Replaced manual frustum creation with `Frustum3D.createOrthographic()` factory method
3. Re-enabled test by removing `.disabled` extension

**Files Changed**:
- `/Users/hal.hildebrand/git/Luciferase/lucien/src/test/java/com/hellblazer/luciferase/lucien/forest/ForestSpatialQueriesTest.java` (fixed and enabled)
- Removed: `ForestSpatialQueriesTest.java.disabled`

### ForestConcurrencyTest.testConcurrentEntityOperations

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Test was failing with "Entity 140097 should exist ==> expected: not <null>"

**Root Cause**: Race condition in test logic where entities could be removed by one thread while another thread expected them to exist.

**Solution**:
1. Changed test to track all inserted entities and removed entities separately
2. Each thread now manages its own entity list to avoid cross-thread removal conflicts
3. Verification phase only checks entities that weren't removed
4. Test now correctly handles concurrent modifications without false failures

**Files Changed**:
- `/Users/hal.hildebrand/git/Luciferase/lucien/src/test/java/com/hellblazer/luciferase/lucien/forest/ForestConcurrencyTest.java` (fixed race condition)
