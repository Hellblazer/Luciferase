# Lucien Architecture Summary

## Purpose

This document provides a high-level summary of the Luciferase lucien module architecture. For detailed information, see the comprehensive documentation in this directory.

## Current State

The lucien module provides spatial indexing through a unified architecture supporting both octree and tetrahedral
decomposition. The module uses inheritance to maximize code reuse while maintaining the unique characteristics of each approach. All core features are complete, including S0-S5 tetrahedral decomposition with 100% geometric containment.

**Total Classes: 96 Java files** organized across 8 packages (after Phase 6.2 node consolidation)

## Package Overview

For detailed package structure and class descriptions, see [LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE.md](./LUCIEN_ARCHITECTURE.md).

- **Root Package (26 classes)**: Core abstractions, spatial types, geometry utilities, performance optimization
- **Entity Package (12 classes)**: Complete entity management infrastructure
- **Octree Package (4 classes)**: Morton curve-based cubic spatial decomposition
- **Tetree Package (31 classes)**: Tetrahedral spatial decomposition with extensive optimizations and lazy evaluation
- **Balancing Package (4 classes)**: Tree balancing strategies
- **Collision Package (12 classes)**: Comprehensive collision detection system
- **Visitor Package (6 classes)**: Tree traversal visitor pattern implementation
- **Index Package (1 class)**: Additional indexing utilities

## Key Architecture Components

### Inheritance Hierarchy

```
SpatialIndex<Key extends SpatialKey<Key>, ID, Content> (interface)
  └── AbstractSpatialIndex<Key, ID, Content> (base class with ~95% shared functionality)
      ├── Octree<ID, Content> extends AbstractSpatialIndex<MortonKey, ID, Content>
      └── Tetree<ID, Content> extends AbstractSpatialIndex<TetreeKey, ID, Content>
```

### Major Features

- **Unified API**: Both octree and tetree share common operations through AbstractSpatialIndex
- **Entity Management**: Centralized through EntityManager with multi-entity support
- **Thread Safety**: ReadWriteLock-based concurrent access
- **Performance**: HashMap-based O(1) node access for both implementations
- **Type-Safe Keys**: SpatialKey architecture prevents mixing incompatible indices

## Design Philosophy

The current architecture prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Essential functionality without unnecessary complexity
2. **Code Reuse**: 90% shared implementation through inheritance
3. **Maintainability**: Single place for algorithm changes
4. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new spatial decomposition strategies
5. **Performance**: O(1) operations through HashMap-based storage
6. **Scalability**: Forest architecture for distributed and large-scale applications

## Performance Reality (June 2025 - OctreeVsTetreeBenchmark)

### Important Performance Update

Previous performance claims were based on using the `consecutiveIndex()` method which is unique only within a level.
After refactoring to use the globally unique `tmIndex()` for correctness (unique across all levels), the performance
characteristics have changed dramatically.

### Current Performance Metrics (Concurrent Optimizations - July 11, 2025)

After ConcurrentSkipListMap integration, the performance characteristics have completely reversed:

| Entities | Operation | Octree  | Tetree  | Winner        | Current State |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 100     | Insertion | 12.58 μs| 5.92 μs | Tetree (2.1x) | **Complete** |
| 1K      | Insertion | 17.89 μs| 4.72 μs | Tetree (3.8x) | **reversal** |
| 10K     | Insertion | 36.87 μs| 5.97 μs | Tetree (6.2x) | **from July** |
| 1K      | k-NN      | 4.15 μs | 2.64 μs | Tetree (1.6x) | Tetree faster |
| 10K     | k-NN      | 19.23 μs| 23.46 μs| Octree (1.2x) | Mixed results |
| 50K+    | Batch     | Baseline| Faster  | Tetree        | 35-38% faster|

### Optimization Timeline

- **June 24**: Initial state - Tetree 770x slower (unusable)
- **June 28**: Subdivision fix + V2 tmIndex - reduced to 6-35x slower
- **June 28**: Parent cache - reduced to 3-7x slower
- **July 5**: Efficient child computation - 3x faster child lookups
- **July 11**: ConcurrentSkipListMap - Tetree now 2.1-6.2x FASTER for insertions
- **Result**: Complete performance reversal from concurrent optimizations

### Performance Reversal Explanation

- **Fundamental algorithms unchanged**: Octree still O(1), Tetree still O(level)
- **ConcurrentSkipListMap impact**: Favors simpler key comparisons (benefits Tetree)
- **Memory trade-off**: Tetree now uses 65-73% of Octree's memory (was 20-25%)
- **Concurrent benefits**: Lock-free reads and reduced contention favor Tetree

## Recent Architecture Changes

### Phase 6.2 Cleanup (July 10, 2025)

1. **Node Class Consolidation**: 
   - Eliminated `TetreeNodeImpl` and `OctreeNode` wrapper classes
   - Created unified `SpatialNodeImpl<ID>` used by both implementations
   - Reduced generic parameters from 4 to 3 throughout the codebase
   - Result: Simpler architecture, reduced memory overhead

2. **K-NN Multi-Level Fix**:
   - Fixed k-NN search to properly find entities at different levels
   - Improved search radius expansion algorithm
   - Increased initial search radius and max expansions

3. **Spanning Entity Queries**:
   - Fixed issue where large entities weren't found by small query regions
   - Updated all query methods to check entities when spanning is enabled

### Performance Optimizations (July 2025)

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: 99.5% memory reduction for large range queries
2. **Parent Caching**: 17.3x speedup for parent() operations  
3. **V2 tmIndex**: 4x speedup over original implementation
4. **Bulk Operations**: 15.5x speedup for batch insertion

### S0-S5 Tetrahedral Decomposition (July 6, 2025)
