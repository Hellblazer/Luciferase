# Collision System Performance Report
**Date: June 28, 2025**

## Overview

This report documents performance benchmarking of the Luciferase collision detection system, including collision shapes, spatial indexing integration, and comparative analysis between Octree and Tetree implementations.

## Test Environment

- **Platform**: Mac OS X aarch64
- **Processor**: 16 cores
- **JVM**: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 24
- **Memory**: 512 MB heap
- **Build Date**: June 28, 2025

## Collision Shape Performance

### Shape-to-Shape Collision Detection

| Shape Type | Performance (ns/collision) | Relative Speed |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Sphere vs Sphere | 32 ns | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Box vs Box | 64 ns | 2.0x slower |
| Capsule vs Capsule | 70 ns | 2.2x slower |
| Oriented Box vs OBB | 79 ns | 2.5x slower |
| Mixed Shapes (avg) | 79 ns | 2.5x slower |

**Observations:**
- Sphere-sphere collision is the fastest at 32ns per check
- Box collision detection is 2x slower due to SAT algorithm
- Oriented box collision requires rotation matrix operations, adding overhead
- Mixed shape collisions use double dispatch pattern

### Ray Intersection Performance

| Shape Type | Performance (ns/intersection) |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Ray-Sphere | 44 ns |
| Ray-Box | 50 ns |
| Ray-Capsule | 75 ns |

**Implementation Details:**
- Ray-sphere intersection uses quadratic formula
- Ray-box uses slab method for AABB intersection
- Ray-capsule requires cylinder + sphere cap checks

## Spatial Index Integration Performance

### Collision Detection with Custom Shapes (1000 entities)

- **Insert + Shape Assignment**: 11 ms total (11 μs per entity)
- **Find All Collisions**: 99 ms
- **Individual Collision Checks**: 4,950 pairs checked in 1 ms
- **Average per check**: < 1 μs (leveraging spatial partitioning)
- **Collisions Found**: 35 (0.7% collision rate)

**Results:**
- Spatial indexing reduces collision checks significantly
- Broad-phase filtering eliminates 99.3% of potential checks
- Custom shapes integrate with spatial indices

## Octree vs Tetree Collision Performance

### Small Scale (100 entities)

| Operation | Octree | Tetree | Winner |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Insertion | 4.79 μs | 10.33 μs | Octree (2.2x) |
| k-NN Search | 0.74 μs | 0.63 μs | Tetree (1.2x) |
| Range Query | 0.39 μs | 0.73 μs | Octree (1.9x) |
| Update | 0.14 μs | 0.06 μs | Tetree (2.2x) |
| Removal | 0.03 μs | 0.01 μs | Tetree (4.8x) |
| Memory | 0.15 MB | 0.04 MB | Tetree (74% less) |

### Medium Scale (1,000 entities)

| Operation | Octree | Tetree | Winner |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Insertion | 2.12 μs | 7.48 μs | Octree (3.5x) |
| k-NN Search | 4.47 μs | 2.20 μs | Tetree (2.0x) |
| Range Query | 2.18 μs | 16.21 μs | Octree (7.4x) |
| Update | 0.002 μs | 0.008 μs | Octree (3.7x) |
| Removal | 0.001 μs | 0.000 μs | Tetree (1.9x) |
| Memory | 1.38 MB | 0.34 MB | Tetree (76% less) |

### Large Scale (10,000 entities)

| Operation | Octree | Tetree | Winner |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Insertion | 1.18 μs | 4.78 μs | Octree (4.0x) |
| k-NN Search | 37.31 μs | 12.26 μs | Tetree (3.0x) |
| Range Query | 21.70 μs | 192.50 μs | Octree (8.9x) |
| Update | 0.002 μs | 0.005 μs | Octree (2.3x) |
| Removal | 0.001 μs | 0.000 μs | Tetree (2.0x) |
| Memory | 12.89 MB | 3.36 MB | Tetree (74% less) |

## Performance Recommendations

### Use Octree When:
1. **Individual insertion performance is critical** (2-4x faster)
2. **Range queries dominate** (7-9x faster)
3. **Real-time applications** requiring consistent low latency
4. **Mixed workloads** with balanced operations

### Use Tetree When:
1. **k-NN queries are primary** (2-3x faster)
2. **Memory efficiency matters** (74-76% less memory)
3. **Bulk loading scenarios** (can be optimized)
4. **Update/removal heavy workloads** (2-5x faster)

## Collision Shape Guidelines

### Performance Hierarchy:
1. **Fastest**: Point collision (0.1f threshold) - use when possible
2. **Fast**: Sphere shapes - simple distance check
3. **Medium**: AABB (BoxShape) - 6 plane checks
4. **Slower**: Capsule shapes - composite calculation
5. **Slowest**: Oriented boxes - rotation transforms required

### Best Practices:
1. Use sphere shapes for approximate collision when precision isn't critical
2. Reserve oriented boxes for objects that truly need rotation
3. Leverage spatial indexing to minimize collision checks
4. Consider LOD (Level of Detail) collision shapes for distant objects
5. Cache collision shape AABBs when possible

## Implementation Quality

### Test Coverage:
- All collision shape types tested
- All shape-to-shape combinations verified
- Ray intersection for all shapes
- Spatial index integration tested
- Performance benchmarks established

### Code Quality:

## Summary

The Luciferase collision system provides the following performance characteristics:

1. Sub-microsecond collision detection when using spatial indexing
2. Multiple shape types with predictable performance trade-offs
3. Integration between collision shapes and spatial indices
4. Memory-efficient Tetree option for large-scale scenarios
5. Comprehensive test coverage
