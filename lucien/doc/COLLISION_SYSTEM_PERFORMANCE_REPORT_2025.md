## Performance Recommendations

### Use Octree When:
1. **Individual insertion performance is critical** (2-4x faster)
2. **Range queries dominate** (7-9x faster)
3. **Real-time applications** requiring consistent low latency
4. **Mixed workloads** with balanced operations

### Use Tetree When:
1. **k-NN queries are primary** (2-3x faster)
2. **Memory efficiency matters** (74-76% less memory)
3. **Bulk loading scenarios** (can be optimized)
4. **Update/removal heavy workloads** (2-5x faster)

## Collision Shape Guidelines

### Performance Hierarchy:
1. **Fastest**: Point collision (0.1f threshold) - use when possible
2. **Fast**: Sphere shapes - simple distance check
3. **Medium**: AABB (BoxShape) - 6 plane checks
4. **Slower**: Capsule shapes - composite calculation
5. **Slowest**: Oriented boxes - rotation transforms required

### Best Practices:
1. Use sphere shapes for approximate collision when precision isn't critical
2. Reserve oriented boxes for objects that truly need rotation
3. Leverage spatial indexing to minimize collision checks
4. Consider LOD (Level of Detail) collision shapes for distant objects
5. Cache collision shape AABBs when possible
