# Luciferase Performance Test Results - July 8, 2025

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the complete performance and benchmark test suite results for the Luciferase spatial indexing project. The tests compare the performance of Octree and Tetree implementations across various operations including insertion, querying, collision detection, and memory usage.

## Test Environment

- **Platform**: Mac OS X aarch64
- **JVM**: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 24
- **Processors**: 16
- **Memory**: 512 MB
- **Date**: July 8, 2025

## Key Performance Findings

### 1. OctreeVsTetreeBenchmark Results

#### Insertion Performance
- **100 entities**: Octree 1.0x faster
- **1,000 entities**: Octree 2.4x faster  
- **10,000 entities**: Octree 11.1x faster

The performance gap increases dramatically with entity count due to Tetree's O(level) tmIndex() computation.

#### K-Nearest Neighbor Search
- **100 entities**: Tetree 1.6x faster
- **1,000 entities**: Tetree 5.3x faster
- **10,000 entities**: Tetree 3.3x faster

Tetree excels at spatial queries despite slower insertion.

#### Range Query Performance
- **100 entities**: Tetree 1.3x faster
- **1,000 entities**: Tetree 2.9x faster
- **10,000 entities**: Tetree 3.6x faster

#### Memory Usage
Tetree consistently uses only 20-25% of Octree's memory across all entity counts.

### 2. QuickPerformanceTest Results

- **1,000 entities insertion**:
  - Octree: 7.09 ms
  - Tetree: 50.99 ms
  - Tetree is 7.2x slower for insertion

### 3. BaselinePerformanceBenchmark Results

Shows optimization effectiveness across different entity counts:

#### 1,000 entities
- Octree Optimized: 2.50x speedup over basic
- Tetree Optimized: 15.50x speedup over basic

#### 100,000 entities
- Octree shows minimal optimization benefit (0.93x)
- Tetree maintains 1.10x optimization benefit

Query performance consistently favors Tetree across all scales.

### 4. Collision Detection Performance

#### OctreeCollisionPerformanceTest
- Scales well with entity count
- Handles 2,000 entities with 3ms insertion, 3ms collision detection
- Efficient bounded entity collision detection

#### TetreeCollisionPerformanceTest
- Slower insertion times (33ms for 800 entities)
- Collision detection performance degrades with scale
- 1,500 entities: 12ms insertion, 208ms collision detection

### 5. Ray Intersection Performance

#### OctreeRayPerformanceTest
- Scales linearly with entity count
- 10,000 entities with 100 rays: 96ms
- Consistent performance across different ray lengths

### 6. TMIndex Performance Analysis

The TetIndexPerformanceTest reveals the core performance issue:

- **Level 1**: tmIndex() 0.7x slower than index()
- **Level 5**: tmIndex() 0.6x slower
- **Level 10**: tmIndex() 1.5x slower
- **Level 15**: tmIndex() 3.1x slower
- **Level 20**: tmIndex() 10.0x slower

This O(level) degradation is the fundamental cause of Tetree's insertion performance issues.

### 7. Geometric Subdivision Benchmark

BeySubdivision performance:
- Level 5: 7.85M operations/second
- Level 15: 23.14M operations/second
- geometricSubdivide() is 5.1x faster than 8x child() calls

## Performance Recommendations

1. **Use Octree for insertion-heavy workloads** - The 11x performance advantage at scale is significant
2. **Use Tetree for query-heavy workloads** - 3-5x faster queries with 75% less memory
3. **Consider hybrid approaches** - Use Octree for dynamic insertion, convert to Tetree for static querying
4. **Leverage optimizations** - Bulk operations and dynamic level selection provide significant benefits

## Optimization Effectiveness

Recent optimizations have been successful:
- Parent cache: 17.3x speedup for parent() calls
- Single-child computation: 3x speedup
- Lazy evaluation: Prevents memory exhaustion for large ranges
- S0-S5 decomposition: Achieved 100% geometric containment

## Conclusion

The Luciferase spatial indexing library offers two complementary implementations:
- **Octree**: Superior insertion performance, suitable for dynamic scenarios
- **Tetree**: Superior query performance and memory efficiency, ideal for static spatial data

The fundamental O(level) cost of tmIndex() in Tetree cannot be eliminated but has been mitigated through caching and optimization. Users should choose the implementation based on their specific workload characteristics.
