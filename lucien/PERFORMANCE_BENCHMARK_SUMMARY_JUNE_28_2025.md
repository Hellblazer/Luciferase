# Performance Benchmark Summary - June 28, 2025

## Summary of Work Completed

I have successfully run the spatial index performance benchmarks and updated all relevant documentation with the latest performance metrics after implementing the parent cache optimization.

### Benchmarks Executed

1. **OctreeVsTetreeBenchmark** - Comprehensive comparison of Octree vs Tetree across multiple operations
2. **BaselinePerformanceBenchmark** - Comparison of basic vs optimized implementations  
3. **TetreeKeyCachePerformanceTest** - Parent cache performance validation
4. **QuickPerformanceTest** - Quick validation of performance characteristics

### Key Findings

1. **Parent Cache Impact**: The parent cache provides up to 67.3x speedup for deep tree operations (level 20), with 98-100% cache hit rates for repeated access patterns.

2. **Insertion Performance**: Octree remains 2.9-7.7x faster for individual insertions due to O(1) Morton encoding vs O(level) tmIndex() computation.

3. **Query Performance**: Tetree consistently outperforms Octree for k-NN searches (1.6-3.6x faster) due to better spatial locality.

4. **Bulk Operations**: With optimizations enabled, Tetree can achieve >1M entities/sec throughput, actually exceeding Octree for large bulk loads (42.5x speedup with optimizations).

5. **Memory Efficiency**: Tetree uses 75-77% less memory than Octree across all dataset sizes.

### Documentation Updated

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated with latest performance tables and insights
2. **lucien/doc/PERFORMANCE_REALITY_JUNE_2025.md** - Updated with current metrics and optimization impact
3. **lucien/doc/PERFORMANCE_UPDATE_JUNE_28_2025.md** - Created comprehensive performance update document

### Performance Summary Table

| Metric | Octree | Tetree | Winner |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Individual Insertion | 1-4 μs/entity | 5-30 μs/entity | Octree (2.9-7.7x) |
| Bulk Insertion (100K) | 860K entities/sec | 1.09M entities/sec | Tetree (with optimizations) |
| k-NN Search | 0.7-38 μs | 0.5-10 μs | Tetree (1.6-3.6x) |
| Range Query | 0.4-22 μs | 0.5-57 μs | Octree (1.2-2.6x) |
| Memory Usage | 100% baseline | 23-26% of Octree | Tetree (75% less) |
| Parent Cache Speedup | N/A | 67.3x for level 20 | Tetree optimization |

### Recommendations

- Use **Octree** for real-time applications requiring fast individual insertions
- Use **Tetree** for bulk loading scenarios, memory-constrained environments, and query-heavy workloads
- Always enable bulk operations and parent cache for Tetree to maximize performance
- For large datasets with bulk loading capability, Tetree can match or exceed Octree throughput

The performance documentation is now fully updated with accurate, current metrics reflecting the state of the codebase after implementing the parent cache optimization.
