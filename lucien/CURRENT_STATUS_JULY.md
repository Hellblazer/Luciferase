## Performance Characteristics

### Octree vs Tetree Performance (July 2025)

| Operation            | Octree                        | Tetree                      | Winner & Ratio                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Insertion**        | 1.1-2.4 μs/op                 | 5.1-12.5 μs/op              | **Octree (2.3-11.4x faster)** |
| **k-NN Query**       | 0.7-20.2 μs                   | 0.5-6.2 μs                  | **Tetree (1.6-5.9x faster)**  |
| **Range Query**      | 0.4-20.1 μs                   | 0.3-5.8 μs                  | **Tetree (1.4-3.5x faster)**  |
| **Ray Intersection** | 10ms (10K entities, 100 rays) | 10ms (5K entities, 50 rays) | **Comparable performance**    |
| **Memory**           | 100%                          | 20-25%                      | **Tetree (75-80% less)**      |
| **Update**           | 0.002-0.15 μs                 | 0.003-0.07 μs               | **Mixed results**             |

### Performance Analysis

- **Octree**: Uses Morton encoding (O(1) bit interleaving)
- **Tetree**: Uses tmIndex() with O(level) parent chain traversal
- **Optimizations Applied**: V2 tmIndex implementation, parent caching, efficient subdivision
- **Trade-off**: Tetree's insertion performance decreases with scale due to algorithmic differences
- **Memory**: Tetree's compact representation uses significantly less memory

### Use Cases

- **Octree**: Better suited for insertion-heavy workloads and scenarios requiring predictable performance
- **Tetree**: Better suited for search operations and memory-constrained environments
- **Note**: Performance characteristics vary significantly with dataset size

1. **Partition Coverage**: ~48% gaps and ~32% overlaps in t8code's tetrahedral decomposition
2. **Design Limitation**: Result of t8code's connectivity table approach
3. **Test Impact**: 5 tests disabled due to these geometric limitations
