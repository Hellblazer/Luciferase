# Spatial Index Enhancement Roadmap (Octree & Tetree)

## Implementation Notes

### Dual Implementation Strategy

To ensure both Octree and Tetree benefit from enhancements:

1. **Abstract Base Methods**: Add new abstract methods to AbstractSpatialIndex for geometry-specific operations
2. **Shared Algorithms**: Implement traversal and search logic in the base class
3. **Geometric Abstraction**: Use interfaces for geometric operations (intersection, containment)
4. **Test Both**: Every enhancement must include tests for both Octree and Tetree
5. **Performance Parity**: Ensure optimizations benefit both implementations equally

### Priority Rationale
1. **User Value**: Features most commonly needed in real applications
2. **Building Blocks**: Earlier items enable and simplify later ones
3. **Effort/Impact**: High-value, moderate-effort items prioritized
4. **Architectural Stability**: Incremental changes preserve clean architecture
5. **Dual Benefit**: Prioritize features that enhance both implementations

### Dependencies
- Phase 1 items are independent and can be done in parallel
- Phase 2 items may benefit from Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 items build on Phase 1 and 2 work
- Phase 4 can be done at any time

### Testing Strategy
- Each feature must include tests for BOTH Octree and Tetree
- Performance benchmarks comparing both implementations
- Integration tests verifying consistent behavior
- Backwards compatibility must be maintained
- Geometric correctness validation for tetrahedral operations

### Total Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 7-10 days (increased for dual implementation)
- Phase 2: 11-15 days (increased for dual optimization)
- Phase 3: 9-12 days (increased for dual geometry)
- Phase 4: 3-5 days
- **Total**: 30-42 days of focused development
