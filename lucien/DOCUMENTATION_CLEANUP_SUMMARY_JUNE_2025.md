**Total Archived: 11 files**

## Documents Updated (Performance Reality)

### Core Documentation Updated
1. **CURRENT_STATE_JUNE_2025.md**
   - Updated performance claims from "Tetree 2-3x faster" to accurate "Octree 1125x faster for insertions"
   - Added current June 2025 performance reality
   - Updated recommendations to reflect actual performance characteristics

2. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Updated performance table with current June 2025 measurements
   - Changed insertion performance: 1.5 μs vs 1,690 μs (Octree 1125x faster)
   - Updated query performance: Tetree 5x faster (5.6μs vs 28μs)
   - Updated realistic expectations with current throughput numbers

**Current Total: 34 active documentation files (down from 45)**

## Key Performance Claims Corrected

### Before Cleanup (Incorrect)
- "Tetree outperforms Octree by 2-3x for bulk operations"
- "2-5M entities/sec throughput for Tetree"
- Claims of Tetree being faster for insertions

### After Cleanup (Accurate)
- "Octree 1125x faster for insertions (75ms vs 84,483ms for 50K entities)"
- "Tetree 5x faster for queries (5.6μs vs 28μs range queries)"
- "~590 entities/sec throughput for Tetree vs ~670K for Octree"
- "Root cause: tmIndex() requires O(level) parent chain walk"

## Status

The documentation cleanup successfully:
1. **Archived 11 completed/redundant documents** to reduce clutter
2. **Corrected performance claims** throughout core documentation
3. **Consolidated duplicate information** into authoritative sources
4. **Maintained essential API and architecture documentation**
5. **Reflects December 2025 system reality**

The remaining 34 active documents provide comprehensive, accurate coverage of the Lucien spatial indexing module without outdated or redundant information.
