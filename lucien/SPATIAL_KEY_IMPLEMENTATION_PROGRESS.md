# Spatial Key Implementation Progress

## Overview
Tracking implementation of spatial index key generalization as defined in SPATIAL_INDEX_KEY_GENERALIZATION_ANALYSIS.md

## Phase 1: Key Infrastructure (âœ… COMPLETED)

### Tasks:
- [x] Create `SpatialKey` interface hierarchy
- [x] Implement `MortonKey` class
- [x] Implement `TetreeKey` class
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for key ordering and equality
- [x] Verify spatial locality preservation

### Implementation Status:
- Phase 1 completed successfully on 2025-06-22
- All tests passing (23 tests: MortonKeyTest, TetreeKeyTest, SpatialKeyLocalityTest)
- Key findings:
  - Morton codes in Luciferase DO encode level information
  - The key generalization is needed for Tetree where SFC indices are NOT unique across levels
  - TetreeKey successfully encodes both level and SFC index as a composite key
  - Spatial locality is preserved within levels for both key types

## Phase 2: Core Refactoring (Not Started)
- Update `SpatialIndex` interface to use generic key type
- Refactor `AbstractSpatialIndex` to use `K extends SpatialKey<K>`
- Update `SpatialIndexSet` to work with generic keys
- Ensure all shared functionality remains generic

## Phase 3: Octree Migration (Not Started)
- Update `Octree` to use `MortonKey`
- Modify `calculateSpatialIndex` to return `MortonKey`
- Update all Octree-specific methods
- Run full test suite to ensure no regression

## Phase 4: Tetree Migration (Not Started)
- Update `Tetree` to use `TetreeKey`
- Modify `calculateSpatialIndex` to return `TetreeKey(level, sfcIndex)`
- Fix level encoding to ensure uniqueness
- Verify collision issues are resolved

## Phase 5: Performance Optimization (Not Started)
- Profile key allocation overhead
- Consider key pooling for frequently used keys
- Optimize comparison operations
- Benchmark against current implementation

## Phase 6: Documentation & Cleanup (Not Started)
- Update all documentation
- Remove deprecated long-based methods
- Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture
- Create migration guide for any external users

## Notes:
- Implementation started: 2025-06-22
- Each phase will pause for review before proceeding
