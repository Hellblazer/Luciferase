# Memory Optimization Fix - June 2025

## Problem
OutOfMemoryError occurring during performance tests with large datasets (up to 1M entities) in the StackBasedTreeBuilder when creating a new ArrayList from a synchronized list.

## Solution Implemented
Added optional ID tracking in `StackBasedTreeBuilder` with the `trackInsertedIds` configuration flag.

### Key Changes

1. **StackBasedTreeBuilder.java**
   - Added `trackInsertedIds` boolean flag to `BuildConfig` (default: true)
   - Made ID collection conditional based on configuration
   - High-performance and memory-efficient configs set `trackInsertedIds = false`

2. **AbstractSpatialIndex.java**
   - Updated to handle case where IDs aren't tracked but are expected
   - Returns empty list with warning instead of creating incorrect IDs

3. **Test Updates**
   - Fixed `OctreeBulkPerformanceTest` to use appropriate configuration

### Configuration Options

```java
// For large datasets (disable ID tracking)
BulkOperationConfig.highPerformance()  // trackInsertedIds = false

// For tests that need ID verification
new BulkOperationConfig()
    .withDeferredSubdivision(true)
    .withPreSortByMorton(true)
    .withStackBasedBuilder(true)
    .withStackBuilderThreshold(5000)  // trackInsertedIds = true by default
```

### Benefits
- Enables processing of 1M+ entities without memory issues
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Preserves verification capabilities when needed
- Significantly reduces memory usage for bulk operations

## Current Performance Status
- **Current speedup**: 1.04x-1.16x
- **Target speedup**: 5.0x
- **Gap**: ~3.8x improvement needed

## Next Steps for Performance
1. Fix inefficient single-entity node creation in StackBasedTreeBuilder
2. Optimize Morton sorting (currently performs worse than no sorting)
3. Implement memory pre-allocation
4. Add parallel processing
5. Enhance subdivision strategies
