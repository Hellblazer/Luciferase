# TetreeLevelCache Memory Overhead Analysis
## Updated Calculation (June 2025)

### Static Lookup Tables

1. **HIGH_BIT_TO_LEVEL**
   - Size: 64 bytes (byte[64])
   - Purpose: O(1) level extraction from highest bit position

2. **SMALL_INDEX_TO_LEVEL**
   - Size: 512 bytes (byte[512])
   - Purpose: Fast lookup for indices 0-511 (levels 0-3)

3. **TYPE_TRANSITION_CACHE**
   - Size: 393,216 bytes = 384 KB (byte[6 * 256 * 256])
   - Purpose: O(1) type transitions between levels
   - Note: This was increased from 64KB to handle the full range of packed values

4. **DeBruijnTable**
   - Size: 256 bytes (int[64])
   - Purpose: De Bruijn sequence multiplication for O(1) bit operations

5. **PARENT_CHAIN_CACHE**
   - Size: 8,192 bytes for array references (long[1024][])
   - Plus dynamic allocation for actual chains (varies by usage)
   - Estimated with 50% occupancy, average chain length 10: ~40 KB

6. **INDEX_CACHE_KEYS**
   - Size: 32,768 bytes = 32 KB (long[4096])
   - Purpose: Keys for SFC index cache

7. **INDEX_CACHE_VALUES**
   - Size: 32,768 bytes = 32 KB (long[4096])
   - Purpose: Cached SFC index values

### Total Static Memory Overhead

```
HIGH_BIT_TO_LEVEL:      64 bytes
SMALL_INDEX_TO_LEVEL:   512 bytes
TYPE_TRANSITION_CACHE:  393,216 bytes (384 KB)
DeBruijnTable:          256 bytes
PARENT_CHAIN_CACHE:     ~48,192 bytes (~47 KB with dynamic content)
INDEX_CACHE_KEYS:       32,768 bytes (32 KB)
INDEX_CACHE_VALUES:     32,768 bytes (32 KB)
----------------------------------------
TOTAL:                  ~507,776 bytes (~496 KB)
```

### Memory Overhead Comparison

**Previous Calculation (with 64KB TYPE_TRANSITION_CACHE):**
- Total: ~176 KB

**Current Calculation (with 384KB TYPE_TRANSITION_CACHE):**
- Total: ~496 KB

**Increase:** 320 KB (due to larger type transition cache)

### Memory Efficiency Analysis

The increased memory usage is justified because:

1. **Type Transition Cache Coverage**
   - Now covers all possible type transitions (6 types × 22 levels × 22 levels)
   - Eliminates cache misses that would fall back to O(level) computation
   - 384 KB is still very small compared to typical JVM heap sizes

2. **Trade-off Analysis**
   - Memory cost: 320 KB additional
   - Performance gain: O(level) → O(1) for ALL type transitions
   - Worth it for applications with frequent type queries

3. **Cache Efficiency**
   - With 496 KB total overhead across all caches
   - Supports millions of operations with O(1) performance
   - Memory overhead per operation: negligible

### Optimization Suggestions

If memory is constrained:

1. **Reduce TYPE_TRANSITION_CACHE size**
   - Only cache common transitions (levels 0-15 instead of 0-21)
   - Would reduce from 384 KB to ~147 KB

2. **Reduce INDEX_CACHE_SIZE**
   - From 4096 to 2048 entries
   - Would save 32 KB

3. **Use lazy initialization**
   - Only allocate caches when first used
   - Saves memory in applications that don't use all features

### Conclusion

The updated memory overhead of ~496 KB is still very reasonable for the performance benefits provided. This represents approximately 0.05% of a 1GB heap, making it negligible for most applications while providing significant performance improvements.
