## Performance Claims Corrected

### Critical Updates Made

#### CLAUDE.md (Project Memory)
- ✅ **Performance Table Updated**: June 2025 reality with Octree 1125x faster insertions
- ✅ **Realistic Expectations**: Updated throughput (670K vs 590 entities/sec)
- ✅ **Root Cause Documented**: tmIndex() O(level) vs Morton O(1) distinction

#### CURRENT_STATE_JUNE_2025.md (Status Document)  
- ✅ **Performance Reality**: Changed from "Tetree 2-3x faster" to "Octree 1125x faster"
- ✅ **Recommendations Updated**: Use Octree for insertions, Tetree for queries
- ✅ **Metrics Corrected**: Actual throughput and timing measurements

### Performance Truth (June 2025)

| Metric | Previous Claims | **Current Reality** |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Tetree Insertion** | "2-3x faster than Octree" | **1125x SLOWER than Octree** |
| **Tetree Queries** | "Comparable to Octree" | **5x FASTER than Octree** |
| **Throughput** | "2-5M entities/sec" | **590 entities/sec (Tetree)** |
| **Root Cause** | "Optimizations needed" | **Fundamental O(level) algorithm** |
