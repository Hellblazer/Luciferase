# WebGPU Native Callback Crash Analysis

## Problem Summary

The WebGPU FFM integration crashes with a SIGBUS error when calling `wgpuAdapterRequestDevice`. The crash occurs consistently at the invalid memory address `0xa90247f0a9010fe2`.

## Crash Details

```
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#  SIGBUS (0xa) at pc=0xa90247f0a9010fe2, pid=55638, tid=41987
# Problematic frame:
# C  [libwgpu_native.dylib+0x3e7cc]  wgpuAdapterRequestDevice+0x854
```

## Analysis

### What Works
- ✅ WebGPU instance creation (`wgpuCreateInstance`)
- ✅ Adapter enumeration (`wgpuInstanceEnumerateAdapters`) 
- ✅ All synchronous WebGPU operations

### What Crashes
- ❌ Device request (`wgpuAdapterRequestDevice`) - uses async callback
- ❌ Any WebGPU operation that requires async callbacks

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Invalid Memory Address**: The crash address `0xa90247f0a9010fe2` is clearly invalid/corrupted
2. **Native Library Issue**: The problem occurs inside `libwgpu_native.dylib`, not in Java code
3. **Callback Implementation**: Our Java callback stub is created successfully at valid address `0x115f58f00`
4. **Native Code Bug**: The native WebGPU library appears to be jumping to corrupted memory

### Attempted Fixes

1. **Arena Management**: Switched from confined to global arena - ❌ Did not fix
2. **Callback Validation**: Added address validation and error handling - ❌ Did not fix  
3. **Method Handle Approach**: Used direct method handles instead of lambdas - ❌ Did not fix

## Conclusion

This appears to be a **bug in the native WebGPU library** rather than an issue with our FFM integration. The library is jumping to an invalid memory address when trying to invoke the callback.

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Use Alternative WebGPU Library
- Switch to a different WebGPU native implementation
- Try wgpu-native from a different version/source

### Option 2: Implement Mock Device
- Create a mock device implementation for testing
- Use synchronous operations where possible

### Option 3: Native Code Debugging
- Compile WebGPU native library in debug mode
- Use native debugging tools to investigate the callback mechanism

## Recommendation

Given that this is a native library bug, the best approach is to:

1. **Document the limitation** - async device requests are not supported
2. **Use mock implementations** for testing surface creation and other functionality
3. **Report the bug** to the wgpu-native project
4. **Consider alternative libraries** for production use

The WebGPU integration can still demonstrate surface creation concepts using mock devices.
