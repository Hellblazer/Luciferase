# How to Verify Transform-Based Rendering is Working

## 1. Console Output Verification

When you toggle to transform-based rendering, you'll see console output like:

```
=== Transform-Based Rendering Active ===
Created 47 tetrahedra using only 6 reference meshes
Reference meshes: 6
Transform cache size: 47
Memory saved: ~87%
=====================================
```

This confirms:

- Number of tetrahedra displayed
- Only 6 reference meshes are created (one per type S0-S5)
- Transform caching is working
- Memory savings percentage

## 2. Verification Button

Click the "Verify Rendering Mode" button to see detailed statistics:

### Traditional Mode Output:

```
=== Traditional Rendering Statistics ===
Unique TriangleMesh instances: 47
Total MeshView instances: 47
Memory efficiency ratio: 1.0:1
=====================================
```

### Transform-Based Mode Output:

```
=== Transform-Based Rendering Statistics ===
Unique TriangleMesh instances: 6
Total MeshView instances: 47
Memory efficiency ratio: 7.8:1
=====================================
```

## 3. Visual Verification

1. **Toggle Between Modes**: The visual output should be identical
2. **Performance**: With many entities, transform-based should feel smoother
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor Java heap usage - transform-based uses less memory

## 4. Debug Verification

Add this to your code to inspect the scene graph:

```java
// Count mesh instances
Group root = visualization.getSceneRoot();
long meshCount = root.getChildren().stream()
    .filter(n -> n instanceof MeshView)
    .map(n -> ((MeshView)n).getMesh())
    .distinct()
    .count();
System.out.println("Distinct meshes: " + meshCount);
```

## 5. Expected Results

- **Traditional**: Each tetrahedron has its own TriangleMesh instance
- **Transform-Based**: Exactly 6 TriangleMesh instances, regardless of tetrahedra count
- **Visual Output**: Identical between modes (including axes remaining visible)
- **Memory**: Significant reduction with transform-based (3.3:1 ratio with 20 tetrahedra, higher with more)

## 6. What to Look For

✅ **Working Correctly**:

- Console shows "using only 6 reference meshes"
- Verification shows 6 unique meshes for transform-based
- Visual output unchanged when toggling
- Memory efficiency ratio > 1:1 for transform-based

❌ **Not Working**:

- More than 6 unique meshes in transform-based mode
- Visual differences between modes
- No console output when toggling
- Memory efficiency ratio = 1:1 in transform-based mode
