## Critical Bug Fix (July 31, 2025)

**Vertex Ordering Issue Fixed:**
- **Problem**: Transform-based tetrahedra appeared as mirror images of traditional mesh tetrahedra
- **Root Cause**: PrimitiveTransformManager was using incorrect vertex ordering that didn't match Tet.coordinates()
- **Solution**: Updated PrimitiveTransformManager to use correct vertex indices from Tet.coordinates():
  - S0: {0,1,3,7}, S1: {0,2,3,7}, S2: {0,4,5,7}, S3: {0,4,6,7}, S4: {0,1,5,7}, S5: {0,2,6,7}
- **Test Fix**: Updated TetrahedronCongruenceTest to use matching vertex indices 
- **Verification**: TetrahedronCongruenceTest now passes - all 6 tetrahedra types are congruent
- **Result**: Transform-based and traditional tetrahedra now match exactly in position, orientation, and edge length
