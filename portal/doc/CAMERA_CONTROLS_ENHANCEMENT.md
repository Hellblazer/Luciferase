# CameraView Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
Enhanced the CameraView class with comprehensive panning capabilities and improved camera movement controls.

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Keyboard Controls
- **W/S**: Move forward/backward along Z-axis
- **A/D**: Strafe left/right along X-axis  
- **Q/E**: Move up/down along Y-axis (new)
- **R**: Reset camera to default position (new)
- **SPACE**: Toggle pan mode (new)
- **SHIFT**: Fast movement modifier (existing)
- **CTRL**: Slow/precise movement modifier (enhanced)

### 2. Enhanced Mouse Controls
- **Left Button Drag**:
  - Default: Rotate camera view
  - Pan Mode: Pan camera in XY plane
- **Right Button Drag**: Zoom in/out (changed from X-axis zoom to Y-axis)
- **Middle Button Drag**: Pan in XY plane
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (new)

### 3. New Pan Mode
- Toggle with SPACE key
- When enabled, left mouse drag pans instead of rotates
- Visual feedback through isPanning() method

### 4. Configurable Navigation Speeds
```java
// Set custom navigation speeds
cameraView.setNavigationSpeeds(panSpeed, rotateSpeed, zoomSpeed);
```

### 5. New Public Methods
- `resetCamera()`: Reset camera to default position and orientation
- `setNavigationSpeeds(double pan, double rotate, double zoom)`: Configure navigation speeds
- `isPanning()`: Get current pan mode state
- `setPanning(boolean panning)`: Set pan mode programmatically

## Code Changes

### Fixed Issues
1. Fixed Rotate axes - ry and rz were incorrectly set to X_AXIS, now properly set to Y_AXIS and Z_AXIS
2. Enabled initial camera angles that were commented out
3. Added mouse wheel zoom support

### Implementation Details
- Added state variables for pan mode and navigation speeds
- Enhanced keyboard handler with vertical movement and pan toggle
- Modified mouse drag handler to support pan mode
- Added scroll event handler for mouse wheel zoom
- Implemented camera reset functionality

## Usage Example
```java
CameraView cameraView = new CameraView(subScene);
cameraView.setFirstPersonNavigationEabled(true);

// Configure navigation speeds
cameraView.setNavigationSpeeds(1.5, 1.0, 15.0);

// Enable pan mode by default
cameraView.setPanning(true);

// Start the view timer
cameraView.startViewing();
```

## Benefits
1. More intuitive navigation with standard 3D application controls
2. Pan mode allows easier scene exploration without rotation
3. Vertical movement enables full 3D navigation
4. Mouse wheel provides quick zoom control
5. Reset function helps users recover from disorientation
6. Configurable speeds allow adaptation to different scene scales
