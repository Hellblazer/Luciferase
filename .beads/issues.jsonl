{"id":"Luciferase-zok","title":"[P1] Add SFC distance-based early termination","description":"CONTEXT: Once we have bidirectional SFC expansion, we need early termination to avoid scanning entire dataset. SFC distance provides upper bound on Euclidean distance.\n\nLOCATION: AbstractSpatialIndex.java (new method in bidirectional expansion)\n\nCURRENT PROBLEM:\n- No early termination in SFC traversal\n- Scans continue even when remaining candidates cannot possibly be closer\n- Wastes CPU on provably non-optimal regions\n\nALGORITHM:\n1. During bidirectional expansion, track k-th best Euclidean distance\n2. For each candidate SFC key, compute SFC distance from query point\n3. If SFC distance \u003e k-th best Euclidean distance, terminate expansion in that direction\n4. SFC distance formula: |mortonCode1 - mortonCode2| provides upper bound\n5. Continue expansion in other direction if still viable\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n- Add computeSFCDistance(Key k1, Key k2) method to SpatialKey interface\n- Implement for MortonKey (simple subtraction) and TetreeKey (consecutive index delta)\n- Add early termination logic in bidirectionalSFCExpansion()\n- Track forward/backward expansion independently\n\nTDD REQUIREMENTS:\n- New test: SFCEarlyTerminationTest validates termination correctness\n- Verify termination doesn't cause false negatives (missing actual k-nearest)\n- KNNSFCPruningBenchmark should show reduced candidate evaluations\n- All existing k-NN tests must pass\n- Code must compile cleanly\n\nEXPECTED IMPROVEMENT: Additional 2-3× on top of P1 (combined 100-300× at 100k entities)\n\nREVIEW REQUIREMENTS:\n- Verify SFC distance calculation is mathematically sound\n- Ensure early termination preserves correctness (no false negatives)\n- Code review by code-review-expert agent\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Blocks on Luciferase-akx (bidirectional SFC expansion)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-07T19:09:53.153332-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T19:30:29.661779-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T19:30:29.661779-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"Luciferase-zok","depends_on_id":"Luciferase-akx","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T19:10:41.378412-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
