Sentry Phase 3.3 Results - Spatial Indexing for Neighbor Queries
============================================================
Date: 2025-01-18

## Implementation Summary

Implemented Jump-and-Walk spatial indexing algorithm to accelerate point location queries.
The algorithm maintains landmark tetrahedra distributed across the mesh to reduce walking distance.

## Key Changes

1. Created LandmarkIndex class implementing Jump-and-Walk algorithm
2. Integrated landmark index into MutableGrid with USE_LANDMARK_INDEX flag
3. Landmark selection maintains ~5% of tetrahedra as landmarks
4. Tracks walking steps for performance monitoring

      500 |        0.87 µs   |      0.59 µs   |    31.8%
     1000 |        0.81 µs   |      0.82 µs   |    -1.0%
     2000 |        0.96 µs   |      0.81 µs   |    16.0%

## Analysis

The Jump-and-Walk implementation shows mixed results:

1. **Inconsistent Performance**: Results vary significantly by mesh size
2. **Walking Distance**: Often increases rather than decreases
3. **Query Time**: Shows improvement for some sizes but not others
4. **Theoretical vs Practical**: Did not achieve expected O(n^(1/6)) complexity

## Issues Identified

1. **Landmark Selection**: Current random selection may not produce well-distributed landmarks
2. **Landmark Maintenance**: Landmarks added during construction may not be optimal
3. **Cache Effects**: Small meshes may fit in cache, masking benefits
4. **Overhead**: Landmark lookup overhead may exceed walking savings for small meshes

## Conclusion

While the Jump-and-Walk infrastructure is complete and functional, the current
implementation does not consistently improve performance. The landmark selection
strategy needs refinement to achieve the theoretical benefits.

## Next Steps

1. Improve landmark distribution strategy (e.g., use spatial distribution metrics)
2. Tune landmark ratio based on mesh size
3. Consider hierarchical landmarks for very large meshes
4. Profile to understand where overhead is occurring
