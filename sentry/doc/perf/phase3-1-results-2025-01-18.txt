Sentry SIMD Vectorization Results - Phase 3.1
Date: 2025-01-18
============================================

## Summary
Phase 3.1 implemented SIMD vectorization infrastructure using Java's Vector API
(preview feature). While the infrastructure is complete and functional, the current
implementation shows performance degradation due to overhead.

## Implementation Details
1. Created complete SIMD infrastructure:
   - Abstraction layer for geometric predicates
   - Runtime detection and fallback mechanism
   - Separate source directory for preview features
   - Maven profiles for building with/without SIMD

2. Implemented Vector API operations for:
   - Orientation predicate (3D cross product and dot product)
   - InSphere predicate (4x4 determinant calculation)
   - Batch operations for processing multiple points

3. Key architectural decisions:
   - Used 256-bit vectors (AVX2 compatible)
   - Reflection-based loading to avoid compile-time dependencies
   - Clean separation between scalar and SIMD code

## Benchmark Results

Individual Operations:
- Orientation: 9.22 ns (scalar) vs 315.68 ns (SIMD) - 0.03x speedup
- InSphere: 6.20 ns (scalar) vs 242.47 ns (SIMD) - 0.03x speedup

Batch Operations (1000 points):
- Batch Orientation: 0.01 ms (scalar) vs 0.03 ms (SIMD) - 0.25x speedup

## Analysis
The SIMD implementation is currently slower because:

1. **Setup Overhead**: Creating DoubleVector objects and shuffles has significant cost
2. **Small Problem Size**: Individual geometric predicates operate on 3-4 points,
   not enough to amortize SIMD setup costs
3. **Preview API Overhead**: The incubator Vector API has additional safety checks
4. **Memory Access Patterns**: Current implementation doesn't optimize for cache

## Positive Outcomes
1. **Infrastructure Complete**: All plumbing for SIMD is in place and working
2. **No Impact on Default Build**: SIMD code isolated in separate profile
3. **Future-Ready**: Easy to optimize when Vector API matures
4. **Batch Potential**: Batch operations show better relative performance

## Recommendations
1. Keep infrastructure but don't enable SIMD by default
2. Focus on batch operations where SIMD shows more promise
3. Revisit when Vector API becomes stable (likely Java 25+)
4. Consider native implementations via JNI for critical paths

## Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 3.2 (Parallel Flip Operations) which may provide better
performance gains than SIMD for the current workload characteristics.
