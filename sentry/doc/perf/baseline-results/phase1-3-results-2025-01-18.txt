Sentry Object Pool Benchmark - Phase 1.3
========================================
Date: 2025-01-18

=== Insertion Performance with Object Pooling ===
Average insertion time: 9.90 µs
Successful insertions: 1000/1000

=== Memory Allocation Pressure Test ===
Memory used: 1.92 MB
Grids created: 10
Approximate vertices per grid: 100

Pool Statistics:
Pool[size=3, acquired=91714, released=77298, created=14419, reuse-rate=84.28%]

=== Performance Comparison ===
Before Phase 1.3: 13.00 µs per insertion (from Phase 1.2)
After Phase 1.3: 9.90 µs per insertion
Improvement: 23.8% faster

Key Findings:
- Object pooling achieved 84.28% reuse rate
- Only 14,419 new Tetrahedra created out of 91,714 acquisitions
- Memory usage significantly reduced
- Average insertion time improved by 23.8%

Implementation Details:
- Created thread-safe TetrahedronPool using ConcurrentLinkedQueue
- Pool pre-populated with 64 objects, max size 1024
- Added reset() and clearForReuse() methods to Tetrahedron
- Modified all Tetrahedron allocation sites to use pool
- Added proper cleanup and release back to pool on deletion
