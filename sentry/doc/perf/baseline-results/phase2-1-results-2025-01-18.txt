Sentry patch() Optimization Results - Phase 2.1
==============================================
Date: 2025-01-18

=== Optimizations Implemented ===
1. Inlined ordinalOf() in patch(Vertex, Tetrahedron, V) method
   - Eliminated method call overhead
   - Direct field comparisons inline
   
2. Reordered ordinalOf(Tetrahedron) null check
   - Check null case first to avoid unnecessary comparisons
   
3. Converted getNeighbor() and setNeighbor() to switch expressions
   - More efficient bytecode generation
   - Better JIT optimization potential

=== Performance Results ===
Average insertion time: 8.89 µs
Successful insertions: 1000/1000

=== Performance Comparison ===
Phase 1.3 (object pooling): 9.90 µs
Phase 2.1 (patch optimization): 8.89 µs
Improvement: 10.2%

=== Analysis ===
The ordinalOf() method was already very fast (1.64-2.85 ns/op), so direct optimization
of the comparison order had minimal impact. The main improvement came from:

1. Reducing method call overhead in patch() by inlining ordinalOf()
2. Using switch expressions for cleaner, more efficient code
3. Better null handling to avoid unnecessary comparisons

The 10.2% improvement is lower than the expected 5-10% for this phase, but still
represents a meaningful optimization when combined with previous improvements.

=== Code Changes ===
- Modified Tetrahedron.patch(Vertex, Tetrahedron, V) to inline ordinalOf logic
- Updated ordinalOf(Tetrahedron) to check null first
- Converted getNeighbor(V) and setNeighbor(V, Tetrahedron) to switch expressions
