# Packed (Structure-of-Arrays) Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a systematic plan to implement a Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) version of the Delaunay tetrahedralization algorithm used in the Sentry module. The previous attempt revealed fundamental algorithmic issues, so we will rebuild from first principles with careful analysis and testing at each step.

## Background

The current Object-Oriented (OO) implementation uses an Array-of-Structures (AoS) approach where each Tetrahedron is a separate object with its own fields. This leads to poor cache locality and memory overhead. A Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) approach stores all tetrahedra data in parallel arrays, improving memory density and cache performance.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Documentation

### 1.1 OO Implementation Analysis
- **Goal**: Thoroughly understand the existing algorithm
- **Tasks**:
  - Document the core data structures (Tetrahedron, Vertex, OrientedFace)
  - Map the relationships and invariants
  - Trace the algorithm flow for key operations
  - Identify critical invariants that must be preserved

### 1.2 Algorithm Documentation
- **Goal**: Create comprehensive documentation of the algorithm
- **Deliverables**:
  - Data structure relationships diagram
  - Algorithm flow charts for:
    - locate() - walking through mesh to find containing tetrahedron
    - flip1to4() - inserting vertex inside tetrahedron
    - flip2to3() and flip3to2() - bistellar flips
    - Edge flip cascades
  - Invariants document listing all conditions that must hold

## Phase 2: Design

### 2.1 SoA Data Structure Design
- **Goal**: Design efficient packed data structures
- **Key Structures**:
  ```
  PackedGrid:
    - vertices: FloatArrayList (x,y,z triplets)
    - tetrahedra: IntArrayList (a,b,c,d vertex indices)
    - adjacent: IntArrayList (4 neighbors per tetrahedron)
    - freed: Deque<Integer> (reusable tetrahedron slots)
  ```

### 2.2 Memory Layout Design
- **Goal**: Optimize for cache efficiency
- **Considerations**:
  - Alignment for SIMD operations
  - Minimizing false sharing
  - Efficient index management
  - Handling deletion and reuse

## Phase 3: Implementation

### 3.1 Core Data Structures (Week 1)
- Implement basic PackedGrid structure
- Implement PackedTetrahedron proxy object
- Create comprehensive unit tests for:
  - Creation and initialization
  - Basic getters/setters
  - Memory management (allocation/deallocation)
  
### 3.2 Basic Operations (Week 1)
- Implement tetrahedron operations:
  - Vertex access (a(), b(), c(), d())
  - Neighbor access and modification
  - Orientation tests
- Create tests comparing with OO implementation

### 3.3 Locate Algorithm (Week 2)
- Implement the mesh walking algorithm
- Handle edge cases:
  - Starting from deleted tetrahedra
  - Points outside convex hull
  - Degenerate cases
- Extensive testing with known meshes

### 3.4 Flip Operations (Week 2)
- Implement flip1to4 (vertex insertion)
- Implement flip2to3 and flip3to2
- Handle neighbor patching correctly
- Test each flip type in isolation

### 3.5 Insert/Track Operations (Week 3)
- Implement the full insertion algorithm
- Handle ear processing and flip cascades
- Maintain mesh invariants
- Test with systematic point sets

### 3.6 Vertex Tracking (Week 3)
- Implement vertex management
- Handle vertex deletion/untracking
- Maintain vertex-tetrahedron adjacency

## Phase 4: Validation

### 4.1 Correctness Validation
- **Goal**: Ensure algorithmic correctness
- **Tests**:
  - Side-by-side comparison with OO implementation
  - Invariant checking after each operation
  - Stress testing with random point sets
  - Edge case validation

### 4.2 Performance Validation
- **Goal**: Verify performance improvements
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Insertion performance
  - Query performance (locate, k-NN)
  - Memory usage
  - Cache miss rates

## Phase 5: Integration

### 5.1 API Compatibility
- Ensure drop-in replacement capability
- Handle all existing use cases
- Maintain thread safety guarantees

### 5.2 Documentation
- API documentation
- Performance characteristics
- Migration guide

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Maintain Invariants**: Every operation must preserve:
   - Delaunay property
   - Mesh connectivity
   - Vertex-tetrahedron adjacency
   
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component thoroughly before building on it

3. **Side-by-Side Validation**: Continuously compare with OO implementation

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance at each step to ensure we're achieving goals

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity Risk**: Start with simplest operations and build up
2. **Correctness Risk**: Extensive invariant checking and comparison testing
3. **Performance Risk**: Profile early and often
4. **Integration Risk**: Maintain API compatibility from the start

## Timeline

- Week 1: Analysis and core data structures
- Week 2: Algorithms (locate and flips)
- Week 3: Complete implementation and initial validation
- Week 4: Performance optimization and final validation

## Next Steps

1. Delete existing packed implementation
2. Create comprehensive analysis of OO implementation
3. Begin systematic implementation following this plan

## Success Metrics

1. **Correctness**: 100% test parity with OO implementation
2. **Performance**: 2-3x improvement in insertion time
3. **Memory**: 50% reduction in memory usage
4. **Cache**: Significant reduction in cache misses
