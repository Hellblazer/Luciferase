# Sentry Implementation Limitations

This document analyzes the limitations discovered through comprehensive testing of the MutableGrid and Grid Delaunay triangulation implementation.

## 1. Numerical Precision Issues with Fast Predicates

### Current State
The implementation uses fast (approximate) geometric predicates instead of exact predicates for performance reasons.

### Impact
- Delaunay property violations in edge cases
- Particularly problematic with:
  - Grid-aligned points
  - Co-spherical points  
  - Points with integer coordinates
  - Near-degenerate configurations

### Test Evidence
```java
// MutableGridTest.java line 139
"WARNING: 10 tetrahedra violate Delaunay property. This is expected with fast predicates."

// DelaunayValidationTest.java line 174
"For grid points, we might have some violations due to numerical precision"
```

### Root Cause
Fast predicates use floating-point arithmetic without adaptive precision or exact computation fallbacks.

## 2. Rebuild Method Incomplete Implementation

### Current State
The `rebuild()` method fails to properly preserve vertex-tetrahedron relationships.

### Impact
- Vertices lose their adjacent tetrahedron references
- Only 20-50% of vertices maintain correct relationships after rebuild
- Makes the grid unusable for certain operations post-rebuild

### Test Evidence
```java
// MutableGridTest.java testRebuild()
"WARNING: Only 32 out of 100 vertices preserved after rebuild"
"Note: rebuild() may not correctly preserve all vertex relationships"
```

### Root Cause
The rebuild process reconstructs tetrahedra but doesn't properly update all vertex back-references.

## 3. Memory Management Issues

### Current State
Untracking vertices doesn't actually free memory or reduce the vertex count.

### Impact
- Memory leaks in long-running applications
- `size()` method returns incorrect values after untracking

### Test Evidence
```java
// MutableGridTest.java line 169
"size doesn't decrease with untrack in current implementation"
```

### Root Cause
The untrack mechanism appears to be partially implemented or broken.

## 4. Degenerate Configuration Handling

### Current State
The system creates degenerate (near-zero volume) tetrahedra but doesn't handle them specially.

### Impact
- Numerical instability in geometric calculations
- Potential infinite loops in flip operations
- Incorrect Delaunay property validation

### Test Evidence
Multiple tests check for degenerate tetrahedra with volume < 1e-6, showing they exist but aren't filtered.

## 5. Thread Safety Concerns

### Current State
No explicit thread-safety guarantees despite having concurrent modification tests.

### Impact
- Potential race conditions in multi-threaded environments
- Unclear if the data structure is meant to be thread-safe

### Test Evidence
`testConcurrentModificationSafety()` exists but only tests single-threaded concurrent modification.

## 6. Topological Consistency Edge Cases

### Current State
Bidirectional neighbor relationships can become inconsistent, especially with null adjacent references.

### Impact
- Navigation operations may fail
- Topology queries return incomplete results

### Test Evidence
Multiple null checks required in tests for vertex.adjacent being null.

## 7. Incomplete Voronoi Implementation

### Current State
`voronoiRegion()` method exists but returns minimal/placeholder data.

### Impact
- Cannot compute proper Voronoi diagrams
- Limited dual structure functionality

### Test Evidence
Tests only verify method doesn't crash, not correctness of results.
