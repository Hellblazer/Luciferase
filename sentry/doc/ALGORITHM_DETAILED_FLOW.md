# Detailed Algorithm Flow Analysis

## 1. Locate Algorithm

The locate algorithm finds which tetrahedron contains a given point by walking through the mesh.

### Algorithm Steps:
```
locate(query_point, start_tetrahedron):
    current = start_tetrahedron
    
    while true:
        // Check each face of current tetrahedron
        negative_face = -1
        for face in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
            orientation = current.orientationWrt(face, query_point)
            if orientation < 0:
                negative_face = face
                break
        
        if negative_face == -1:
            // Point is inside current tetrahedron
            return current
            
        // Move to neighbor through negative face
        neighbor = current.getNeighbor(negative_face)
        if neighbor == null:
            // Hit convex hull boundary
            return null
            
        // Continue walk from neighbor
        current = neighbor
```

### Key Observations:
- Uses randomized face checking order to avoid worst-case behavior
- Terminates when point is inside a tetrahedron or outside convex hull
- Performance depends on mesh quality and starting position

## 2. Flip Operations

### 2.1 flip1to4 (Vertex Inside Tetrahedron)

```
flip1to4(tetrahedron, new_vertex):
    // Create 4 new tetrahedra
    t0 = new Tetrahedron(a, b, c, new_vertex)
    t1 = new Tetrahedron(a, d, b, new_vertex)
    t2 = new Tetrahedron(a, c, d, new_vertex)
    t3 = new Tetrahedron(b, d, c, new_vertex)
    
    // Set internal neighbors (facing new_vertex)
    t0.setNeighborD(t3)
    t0.setNeighborA(t2)
    t0.setNeighborB(t1)
    
    t1.setNeighborD(t3)
    t1.setNeighborB(t0)
    t1.setNeighborC(t2)
    
    t2.setNeighborD(t3)
    t2.setNeighborC(t1)
    t2.setNeighborB(t0)
    
    t3.setNeighborD(t2)
    t3.setNeighborA(t0)
    t3.setNeighborB(t1)
    
    // Patch external neighbors
    patch(neighbor_of_face_BCD, t0, face_opposite_A)
    patch(neighbor_of_face_ACD, t1, face_opposite_B)
    patch(neighbor_of_face_ABD, t2, face_opposite_C)
    patch(neighbor_of_face_ABC, t3, face_opposite_D)
    
    // Delete original tetrahedron
    delete(tetrahedron)
    
    // Return faces that might violate Delaunay
    ears = []
    for each new_tet in [t0, t1, t2, t3]:
        external_face = new_tet.getFaceOpposite(new_vertex)
        if external_face.hasNeighbor():
            ears.add(external_face)
    
    return ears
```

### 2.2 Patch Operation

The patch operation updates bidirectional neighbor relationships:

```
patch(face_vertex, new_tetrahedron, new_face):
    old_neighbor = this.getNeighbor(face_vertex)
    if old_neighbor != null:
        // Find which face of old_neighbor points back to us
        for face in old_neighbor.faces:
            if old_neighbor.getNeighbor(face) == this:
                old_neighbor.setNeighbor(face, new_tetrahedron)
                break
    
    new_tetrahedron.setNeighbor(new_face, old_neighbor)
```

## 3. Insertion Algorithm

The complete point insertion algorithm:

```
insert(vertex, containing_tetrahedron):
    // Initial flip based on vertex position
    if vertex inside containing_tetrahedron:
        ears = flip1to4(containing_tetrahedron, vertex)
    else if vertex on face of containing_tetrahedron:
        ears = flip2to3(containing_tetrahedron, neighbor, vertex)
    else if vertex on edge:
        ears = flipNtoM(ring_around_edge, vertex)
    
    // Process ears to restore Delaunay property
    while ears not empty:
        face = ears.pop()
        
        // Check if face violates Delaunay property
        if face.needsFlip(vertex):
            new_ears = face.flip(vertex)
            ears.extend(new_ears)
```

## 4. Ear Processing (Delaunay Restoration)

After insertion, we must restore the Delaunay property:

```
OrientedFace.flip(vertex):
    incident = this.getIncident()
    adjacent = this.getAdjacent()
    
    // Determine flip type based on configuration
    reflex_edges = countReflexEdges(vertex)
    
    if reflex_edges == 0:
        // Face is locally Delaunay, no flip needed
        return []
    else if reflex_edges == 1:
        // Perform 2->3 flip
        return flip2to3(incident, adjacent, vertex)
    else if reflex_edges == 2:
        // Check if 3->2 flip is valid
        if canFlip3to2():
            return flip3to2(...)
        else:
            // Handle degenerate case
            return handleDegenerateCase()
```

## 5. Critical Implementation Details

### 5.1 Vertex Ordering
- Must maintain consistent orientation: (a,b,c) positive w.r.t. d
- When creating new tetrahedra, vertex order matters

### 5.2 Face Enumeration
- Face opposite A: contains vertices B, C, D
- Face opposite B: contains vertices A, C, D
- Face opposite C: contains vertices A, B, D
- Face opposite D: contains vertices A, B, C

### 5.3 Neighbor Mapping
The mapping between faces must be consistent:
- If T1's face opposite A neighbors T2
- Then T2's face opposite X neighbors T1
- Where X is the vertex in T2 not shared with T1

### 5.4 Locate Starting Point
- Use spatial locality: start from last accessed tetrahedron
- Fallback to vertex adjacency for nearby searches
- Random starting point for worst-case avoidance

## 6. Edge Cases and Degeneracies

### 6.1 Coplanar Points
- Four coplanar points cannot form a valid tetrahedron
- Must detect and handle during insertion

### 6.2 Boundary Points
- Points on convex hull boundary need special handling
- May expand the convex hull

### 6.3 Duplicate Points
- Can either reject or merge with existing vertex
- Current implementation allows duplicates

### 6.4 Numerical Precision
- Use robust geometric predicates
- Handle near-degenerate configurations

## 7. Optimization Techniques

### 7.1 Spatial Locality
- Track 'last' tetrahedron for subsequent searches
- Most insertions are spatially coherent

### 7.2 Memory Pooling
- Reuse deleted tetrahedron objects
- Reduces allocation overhead

### 7.3 Lazy Deletion
- Mark as deleted rather than immediately freeing
- Batch cleanup during quiet periods

### 7.4 Walking Strategy
- Randomized face order prevents adversarial inputs
- Straight-line walk is usually near-optimal
