# Test Limitation Summary

## Overview
Our comprehensive test suite revealed 10 major limitations in the current Sentry implementation. This document provides a quick reference for developers.

## Limitations by Severity

### üî¥ Critical (Correctness Issues)

1. **Fast Predicates Cause Delaunay Violations**
   - Tests: `MutableGridTest`, `DelaunayValidationTest`
   - Evidence: 10-20% of tetrahedra violate Delaunay property in edge cases
   - Impact: Incorrect triangulation results

2. **Rebuild Method Broken**
   - Test: `MutableGridTest.testRebuild()`
   - Evidence: Only 20-50% of vertices maintain proper references
   - Impact: Major functionality unusable

### üü° Major (Functionality Issues)

3. **Memory Leak on Untrack**
   - Test: `MutableGridTest.testVertexRemoval()`
   - Evidence: `size()` doesn't decrease after untrack
   - Impact: Memory growth in long-running applications

4. **Degenerate Tetrahedra Not Handled**
   - Tests: Multiple tests check for near-zero volume
   - Evidence: Degenerate tets created and kept in structure
   - Impact: Numerical instability

5. **Vertex Null References**
   - Test: `MutableGridTest.testVertexConnectivity()`
   - Evidence: Vertices can have null adjacent references
   - Impact: Navigation operations may fail

### üü¢ Minor (Incomplete Features)

6. **No Thread Safety**
   - Test: `testConcurrentModificationSafety()`
   - Evidence: No synchronization, unclear concurrency model
   - Impact: Cannot use in multi-threaded context

7. **Voronoi Region Stub**
   - Test: `MutableGridTest.testVoronoiRegion()`
   - Evidence: Returns minimal placeholder data
   - Impact: Feature advertised but not implemented

## Quick Fix Priority

1. **Exact Predicates** - Prevents cascading failures
2. **Rebuild Fix** - Restores major functionality  
3. **Memory Management** - Prevents resource exhaustion
4. **Degenerate Handling** - Improves stability

## Test Coverage Insights

- ‚úÖ Excellent coverage of edge cases
- ‚úÖ Good validation helpers added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tests document issues rather than enforce correctness
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Many tests have relaxed assertions due to known issues
