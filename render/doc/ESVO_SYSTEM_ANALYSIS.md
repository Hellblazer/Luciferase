## Conclusion

The lucien module provides a solid foundation for implementing ESVO in Java. Approximately 40-50% of the required functionality exists and can be reused or adapted. The main implementation effort will focus on:

1. Voxelization pipeline (new)
2. GPU integration (new)
3. File format support (new)
4. Compression systems (new)
5. Streaming architecture (partial reuse)

By building on lucien's spatial index architecture and extending it with ESVO-specific features, we can create an efficient Java implementation while maintaining code quality and performance.
