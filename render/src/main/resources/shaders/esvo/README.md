# ESVO Shaders

Placeholder directory for ESVO compute shaders.

## Required Shaders

The following shaders are referenced in the code but not yet implemented:

- `visibility.wgsl` - Visibility determination for voxels
- `shading.wgsl` - Voxel shading calculations  
- `sparse_octree.wgsl` - Sparse octree traversal
- `ray_marching.wgsl` - Ray marching through voxel data

These will be implemented when full GPU ray marching is added.
