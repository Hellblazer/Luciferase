/**
 * Luciferase Render Module
 * 
 * This module provides high-performance voxel-based rendering capabilities for the Luciferase
 * 3D spatial data structure library. It includes GPU-accelerated voxelization, memory-efficient
 * octree storage, and streaming I/O for large-scale 3D data visualization.
 * 
 * The render module is designed to work with Luciferase's spatial indexing systems (Octree and
 * Tetree) to provide real-time visualization of spatial data structures and their contents.
