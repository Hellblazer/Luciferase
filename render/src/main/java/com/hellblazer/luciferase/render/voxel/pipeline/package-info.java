/**
 * Voxelization Processing Pipeline
 * 
 * Processing pipeline for converting 3D geometry into voxel representations.
 * Includes Voxelizer for mesh-to-voxel conversion and TriangleProcessor for
 * geometric primitive processing.
 * 
 * The pipeline system provides a flexible framework for transforming various
 * input formats (meshes, point clouds, primitives) into hierarchical voxel
 * structures suitable for rendering and spatial queries.
