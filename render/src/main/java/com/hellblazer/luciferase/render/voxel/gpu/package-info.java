/**
 * GPU Acceleration for Voxel Processing
 * 
 * WebGPU-based compute shaders and GPU context management for accelerated voxel
 * operations. Includes WebGPUContext for device management and ComputePipeline
 * for shader execution.
 * 
 * This package provides the interface between CPU-based voxel data structures
 * and GPU compute shaders, enabling high-performance parallel processing of
 * voxel operations such as rasterization, filtering, and rendering.
