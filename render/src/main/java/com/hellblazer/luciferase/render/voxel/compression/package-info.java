/**
 * Voxel Data Compression
 * 
 * Compression algorithms for efficient storage and transmission of voxel data.
 * Includes DXTEncoder for texture compression and OctreeSerializer for
 * hierarchical data compression.
 * 
 * The compression system reduces memory footprint and I/O bandwidth requirements
 * for large voxel datasets while maintaining acceptable quality and performance
 * for real-time rendering applications.
