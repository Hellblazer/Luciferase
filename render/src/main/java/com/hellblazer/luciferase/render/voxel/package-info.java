/**
 * Voxel Rendering System
 * 
 * Core voxel rendering infrastructure for converting 3D spatial data into voxel representations
 * suitable for GPU-accelerated rendering. This package provides the foundation for all voxel-based
 * operations including data structures, processing pipelines, and rendering algorithms.
 * 
 * The voxel system is designed to efficiently handle large-scale 3D datasets through hierarchical
 * octree structures, memory pooling, and GPU compute shaders.
