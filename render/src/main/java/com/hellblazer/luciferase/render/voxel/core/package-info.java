/**
 * Voxel Core Data Structures
 * 
 * Core data structures for voxel representation including VoxelOctreeNode and VoxelData.
 * These classes provide the fundamental building blocks for hierarchical voxel storage
 * and manipulation.
 * 
 * The core package defines the basic voxel data model used throughout the rendering
 * system, including node hierarchies, voxel properties, and spatial relationships.
