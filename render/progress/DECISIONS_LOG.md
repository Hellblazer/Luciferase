**Status**: ✅ Approved  
**Review Date**: August 12, 2025  

**Context**:
Starting ESVO implementation project requires comprehensive progress tracking to manage complexity and ensure deliverables are met on schedule.

**Decision**:
Implement 5-file progress tracking system:
1. MASTER_PROGRESS.md - Executive overview and phase status
2. PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md - Detailed current phase tracking  
3. DAILY_LOG.md - Daily progress entries with time tracking
4. DECISIONS_LOG.md - Architecture and design decisions (this file)

### D002: Event Timestamp Precision
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Approved  
**Review Date**: August 20, 2025  

**Context**:
Event cameras generate events with very high temporal resolution. Need to determine appropriate timestamp precision for internal representation.

**Decision**:
Use microsecond precision represented as `long` timestamp (microseconds since epoch).

**Rationale**:
- Event cameras typically operate at microsecond timescales
- Microsecond precision is sufficient for visual odometry algorithms
- `long` provides good memory efficiency vs precision trade-off
- Standard Java time APIs support microsecond operations
- Matches precision used in many event camera datasets

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Nanosecond precision (`long` nanoseconds) - Rejected: Unnecessary precision, higher memory usage
2. Millisecond precision (`int` milliseconds) - Rejected: Insufficient for event processing
3. Custom high-precision time class - Rejected: Unnecessary complexity

**Impact**:
- Memory usage: 8 bytes per event for timestamp
- Processing: Standard Java time operations available
- Compatibility: Matches common event camera data formats
- Scalability: Supports up to ~292,000 years from epoch

**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Approved  
**Review Date**: August 20, 2025  

**Context**:
Event streams can contain millions of events requiring efficient storage and processing. Need to balance memory efficiency with processing flexibility.

**Decision**:
Implement hybrid storage strategy:
- **Bulk storage**: Use primitive arrays for large static event collections
- **Processing**: Use Java collections (List, Set) for dynamic operations
- **Streaming**: Use ring buffers for real-time event streams

**Rationale**:
- Arrays provide optimal memory density for large datasets
- Collections provide flexibility for complex operations
- Ring buffers enable efficient streaming with bounded memory
- Allows optimization for different use cases

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Pure collections approach - Rejected: High memory overhead for bulk storage
2. Pure arrays approach - Rejected: Complex processing logic, type safety issues
3. Custom data structures - Rejected: Development time vs benefit trade-off

**Impact**:
- Memory efficiency: ~40% reduction vs pure collections for bulk data
- Processing flexibility: Maintained through collection conversion when needed
- Development complexity: Moderate increase due to multiple storage types
- Performance: Optimal for both storage and processing patterns

### D004: Integration with Luciferase Spatial Indexing
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Status**: 🟡 Proposed  
**Review Date**: August 15, 2025  

**Context**:
ESVO processing will benefit from Luciferase's advanced spatial indexing capabilities. Need to define integration approach for mapping events to spatial structures.

**Decision**: [To be finalized in Phase 2]
Proposed approach: Create EventSpatialAdapter to map events into existing SpatialIndex structures.

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing optimized spatial indexing
- Maintains separation of concerns between event processing and spatial operations
- Allows reuse of existing spatial query capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Separate spatial indexing for events - May miss optimization opportunities
2. Direct integration into SpatialIndex - Risk of coupling event-specific logic

**Impact**:
- TBD based on detailed analysis in Phase 2

**Context**:
GPU compute shaders require specific memory layouts and alignment for optimal performance. VoxelOctreeNode and VoxelData structures must be compatible with GPU memory access patterns.

**Decision**:
Implement bit-packed memory layouts with GPU alignment guarantees:
- VoxelOctreeNode: 64-bit packed structure (8 bytes) with atomic field access
- VoxelData: 64-bit packed RGBA + normal + material data (8 bytes)

- Native memory synchronization through FFM Arena management

**Rationale**:
- Matches NVIDIA ESVO specification exactly
- Enables direct GPU buffer mapping without data transformation
- Optimal cache performance on both CPU and GPU
- Atomic operations provide thread safety without performance impact

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Structure of arrays (SoA) - Rejected: More complex for mixed access patterns
