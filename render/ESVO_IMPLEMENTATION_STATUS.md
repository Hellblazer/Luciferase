### Known Issues and Stubs

#### 1. OctreeBuilder (Stub Implementation)
- **Location**: `com.hellblazer.luciferase.esvo.core.OctreeBuilder`
- **Status**: Minimal stub, only used in ESVOPhase3Demo
- **Impact**: Low - demo still functions with stub
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Contains basic voxel addition method
  - Serialize method only writes header
  - Full octree construction not implemented
  - Would need breadth-first serialization for production

#### 2. Performance Considerations
- Parallel subdivision test shows minimal speedup due to small workload
- Thread overhead dominates for small datasets
- Production use would benefit from larger batch sizes

### Critical Implementation Details

#### Coordinate Space
- All implementations correctly use [1,2] space (NOT [0,1])
- Proper transformations in all ray traversal and builder code

#### GLSL Shader Fixes
- All three critical shader fixes from memory bank are implemented:
  1. popc8 child indexing 
  2. Far pointer resolution
  3. Contour intersection normalization

#### Memory Management
- Exclusively uses LWJGL MemoryUtil (no Unsafe or DirectByteBuffer)
- Proper alignment with memAlignedAlloc()
- Thread-safe memory operations
