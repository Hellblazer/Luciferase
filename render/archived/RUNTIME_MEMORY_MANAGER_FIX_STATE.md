# RuntimeMemoryManager Test Failures - COMPLETED

## Final Status
- **Date**: 2025-08-10
- **Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING
- **Test Results**: 399 tests, 0 failures, 6 skipped (intentionally disabled)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. testMemoryPressureEviction - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Expected evictions > 0 but got 0

**Root Cause**: 
- The test wasn't setting `config.aggressiveEviction = true`
- Without aggressive eviction, nodes were only moved between hot and warm caches, not actually evicted

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `config.aggressiveEviction = true` in test setup (lines 101-102 of RuntimeMemoryManagerTest.java)

### 2. testNodePersistence - FIXED ✅  
**Problem**: Expected nodeId 500 but got 0

**Root Cause**: 
- Object pooling mechanism was trying to reuse ManagedNode objects
- ManagedNode.nodeId is a final field and cannot be reset when reusing pooled objects
- This caused pooled nodes to always have nodeId = 0

**Fix Applied**:
- Disabled the broken pooling mechanism in RuntimeMemoryManager.allocateNode() (lines 584-593)
- Now always creates new ManagedNode instances instead of trying to reuse pooled ones

### 3. WebGPU Shader Validation Error - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: WGSL validation error in ray_traversal.wgsl

**Error**: "automatic conversions cannot convert elements of `i32` to `u32`"

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed line 98 in ray_traversal.wgsl from:
  ```wgsl
  let level_size = f32(1 << (config.octree_max_depth - i32(node.level)));
  ```
  to:
  ```wgsl
  let level_size = f32(1u << u32(config.octree_max_depth - i32(node.level)));
  ```

### 4. GPU Test Hardware Detection - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: GPU tests were being skipped despite hardware being available

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **WebGPU.isAvailable()** (webgpu-ffm module):
   - Changed from simplistic library path check to actual WebGPU initialization attempt
   - Now returns true only if WebGPU can actually be initialized

2. **WebGPUIntegrationTest**:
   - Fixed `checkWebGPUAvailability()` which was hardcoded to return false
   - Now uses `WebGPU.isAvailable()` for actual hardware detection
   - Fixed alignment test expectations (FFM doesn't guarantee 256-byte alignment)

## Commands to Verify
```bash
# Run all tests in render module
cd /Users/hal.hildebrand/git/Luciferase/render
mvn test

# Expected output:
# Tests run: 399, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 6
```

## Remaining Skipped Tests (Intentional)
These tests are intentionally disabled with @Disabled annotation:
- 2 in ComputeShaderManagerTest (features not yet implemented)
- 1 in VoxelStreamingIOTest (LOD streaming incomplete)
- 3 others with legitimate skip reasons

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check test configuration for flags like `aggressiveEviction`
2. Be careful with object pooling when fields are final
3. WebGPU availability checks should actually attempt initialization
4. WGSL requires explicit type conversions for bitwise operations
5. **IMPORTANT**: Reuse existing test output instead of rerunning long operations

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
All RuntimeMemoryManager tests and GPU tests are now passing successfully.
